However, the “inositol depletion theory” suggests  main potential targets. These targets are inositol monophosphatase, inositol polyphosphatase, and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-),.The “Inositol depletion theory” suggests lithium behaves as an uncompetitive inhibitor of inositol monophosphatase in a manner inversely proportional to the degree of stimulus. This inhibition lowers levels of inositol triphosphate. However, stronger inhibitors of inositol monophosphatase are not as clinically effective and low levels of inositol triphosphate are associated with memory impairment,.Lithium acts on inositol polyphosphatase as an uncompetitive inhibitor. This inhibition is thought to have multiple downstream effects that have yet to be clarified.Lithium regulates phosphorylation of GSK- which regulates other enzymes through phosphorylation.

This is the event that triggers the nerve impulse to the brain which allows for the perception of light. All-trans-retinal is then released from opsin and reduced to all-trans-retinol. All-trans-retinol is isomerized to -cis-retinol in the dark, and then oxidized to -cis-retinal. -cis-retinal recombines with opsin to re-form rhodopsin. Night blindness or defective vision at low illumination results from a failure to re-synthesize -cisretinal rapidly. Epithelial differentiation: The role of Vitamin A in epithelial differentiation, as well as in other physiological processes, involves the binding of Vitamin A to two families of nuclear retinoid receptors (retinoic acid receptors, RARs; and retinoid-X receptors, RXRs).

Danazol also depresses the preovulatory surge in output of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thereby reducing ovarian estrogen production. Danazol may also directly inhibits ovarian steroidogenesis; bind to androgen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors; bind to sex-hormone-binding globulin and corticosteroid-binding globulin; and increases the metabolic clearance rate of progesterone. Another mechanism of action by which danazol may use to facilitate regression of endometriosis is by decreasing IgG, IgM, and IgA concentrations, as well as phospholipid and IgG isotope autoantibodies. In the treatment of endometriosis, as a consequence of suppression of ovarian function, danazol causes both normal and ectopic endometrial tissues to become inactive and atrophic. This leads to anovulation and associated amenorrhea. In fibrocystic breast disease, the exact mechanism of action of danazol is unknown, but may be related to suppressed estrogenic stimulation as a result of decreased ovarian production of estrogen. A direct effect on steroid receptor sites in breast tissue is also possible. This leads to a disappearance of nodularity, relief of pain and tenderness, and possibly changes in the menstrual pattern.

Lenalidomide exerts immunomodulating effects by altering cytokine production, regulating T cell co-stimulation, and enhancing the NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.Lenalidomide directly inhibits the cullin ring E ubiquitin ligase complex: upon binding to cereblon, a substrate adaptor of the complex, lenalidomide modulates substrate specificity of the complex to recruit substrate proteins of the ligase, including Ikaros (IKZF), Aiolos (IKZF), and CKα.These substrates are then tagged for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. IKZF and IKZF are B-cell transcription factors that are essential for B-cell differentiation and survival of malignant cells. IKZF also regulates the expression of interferon regulatory factor  (IRF), which is a transcription factor that regulates the aberrant myeloma-specific gene. The immunomodulatory actions of lenalidomide can be partly explained by the degradation of IKZF, since it is a repressor of the interleukin  gene (IL): as lenalidomide decreases the level of IKZF, the production of IL- increases, thereby increasing the proliferation of natural killer (NK), NKT cells, and CD+ T cells.Lenalidomide inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-, IL-, and IL-, while elevating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-.Lenalidomide acts as a T-cell co-stimulatory molecule that promotes CD T-cell proliferation and increases the production of IL- and IFN-γ in T lymphocytes, which enhances NK cell cytotoxicity and ADCC. It inhibits the expression and function of T-regulatory cells, which are often overabundant in some hematological malignancies.Lenalidomide directly exerts antitumour effects by inhibiting the proliferation and inducing apoptosis of tumour cells. Lenalidomide triggers the activation of pro-apoptotic caspase-, enhances tumour cell sensitivity to FAS-induced apoptosis, and downregulates NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic protein.Independent of its immunomodulatory effects, lenalidomide mediates anti-angiogenic effects by inhibiting angiogenic growth factors released by tumour cells, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblastic-growth factor (BFGF), and hepatocyte-growth factor.In vitro, lenalidomide inhibits cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-, LFA-, β and β integrins, as well as gap-junction function, thereby preventing metastasis of malignant cells.TargetActionsOrganismAProtein cerebloninhibitorHumansATumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member inhibitorHumansUCadherin-antagonistHumansUProstaglandin G/H synthase negative modulatorHumans",[],"['Acids, Carbocyclic', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Angiogenesis Modulating Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Growth Inhibitors', 'Growth Substances', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Imides', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Isoindoles', 'Myelosuppressive Agents', 'P-glycoprotein substrates', 'Phthalic Acids', 'Phthalimides', 'Piperidines', 'Piperidones', 'Thalidomide Analog']"

This is because the liver preferentially resecretes only alpha-tocopherol by way of the hepatic alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP); the liver metabolizes and excretes all the other vitamin E variants, which is why blood and cellular concentrations of other forms of vitamin E other than alpha-tocopherol are ultimately lower15.Furthermore, the term alpha-tocopherol generally refers to a group of eight possible stereoisomers which is often called all-rac-tocopherol for being a racemic mixture of all eight stereoisomers12,16. Of the eight stereoisomers, the RRR-alpha-tocopherol - or sometimes referred to as the d-alpha-tocopherol - stereoisomer is the naturally occurring form of alpha-tocopherol that is perhaps best recognized by the alpha-TTP12,16and has been reported to demonstrate approximately twice the systemic availability of all-rac-tocopherol16.As a result, often times (but certainly not always) the discussion of vitamin E - at least within the context of using the vitamin for health-related indications - is generally in reference to the use of RRR- or d-alpha-tocopherol.Subsequently, without further evidence to suggest otherwise, alpha-tocpherol succinate is generally believed to undergo a logical de-esterification in the gastrointestinal tract before being subsequently absorbed as free tocopherol6,7.",[H][C@@](C)(CCCC(C)C)CCC[C@@]([H])(C)CCC[C@]1(C)CCC2=C(C)C(OC(=O)CCC(O)=O)=C(C)C(C)=C2O1,"Without further evidence to suggest otherwise, alpha-tocpherol succinate is generally believed to undergo a logical de-esterification in the gastrointestinal tract before being subsequently absorbed as free tocopherol,. The free alpha-tocopherol is therefore available and capable of the following activities.Vitamin E's antioxidant capabilities are perhaps the primary biological action associated with alpha-tocopherol. In general, antioxidants protect cells from the damaging effects of free radicals, which are molecules that consist of an unshared electron. These unshared electrons are highly energetic and react rapidly with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species (ROS). In doing so, free radicals are capable of damaging cells, which may facilitate their contribution to the development of various diseases. Moreover, the human body naturally forms ROS when it converts food into energy and is also exposed to environmental free radicals contained in cigarette smoke, air pollution, or ultraviolet radiation from the sun. It is believed that perhaps vitamin E antioxidants might be able to protect body cells from the damaging effects of such frequent free radical and ROS exposure.Specifically, vitamin E is a chain-breaking antioxidant that prevents the propagation of free radical reactions. The vitamin E molecule is specifically a peroxyl radical scavenger and especially protects polyunsaturated fatty acids within endogenous cell membrane phospholipids and plasma lipoproteins. Peroxyl free radicals react with vitamin E a thousand times more rapidly than they do with the aforementioned polyunsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, the phenolic hydroxyl group of tocopherol reacts with an organic peroxyl radical to form an organic hydroperoxide and tocopheroxyl radical. This tocopheroxyl radical can then undergo various possible reactions: it could (a) be reduced by other antioxidants to tocopherol, (b) react with another tocopheroxyl radical to form non-reactive products like tocopherol dimers, (c) undergo further oxidation to tocopheryl quinone, or (d) even act as a prooxidant and oxidize other lipids.In addition to the antioxidant actions of vitamin E, there have been a number of studies that report various other specific molecular functions associated with vitamin E. For example, alpha-tocopherol is capable of inhibiting protein kinase C activity, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in smooth muscle cells, human platelets, and monocytes. In particular, protein kinase C inhibition by alpha-tocopherol is partially attributable to its attenuating effect on the generation of membrane-derived dialglycerol, a lipid that facilitates protein kinase C translocation, thereby increasing its activity.In addition, vitamin E enrichment of endothelial cells downregulates the expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-) and vascular cell adhesion molecule- (VCAM-), thereby decreasing the adhesion of blood cell components to the endothelium.Vitamin E also upregulates the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A and cyclooxygenase-. The increased expression of these two rate-limiting enzymes in the arachidonic acid cascade explains the observation that vitamin E, in a dose-dependent fashion, enhanced the release of prostacyclin, a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation in humans.Furthermore, vitamin E can inhibit platelet adhesion, aggregation, and platelet release reactions. The vitamin can also evidently inhibit the plasma generation of thrombin, a potent endogenous hormone that binds to platelet receptors and induces aggregation of platelets. Moreover, vitamin E may also be able to decrease monocyte adhesion to the endothellium by downregulating expression of adhesion molecules and decreasing monocyte superoxide production.Given these proposed biological activities of vitamin E, the substance continues to generate ongoing interest and studies in whether or not vitamin E can assist in delaying or preventing various diseases with any one or more of its biologic actions. For instance, studies continue to see whether vitamin E's ability to inhibit low-density lipoprotein oxidation can aid in preventing the development of cardiovascular disease or atherogenesis.Similarly, it is also believed that if vitamin E can decrease the chance of cardiovascular disease then it can also decrease the chance of related diabetic disease and complications. In much the same way, it is also believed that perhaps the antioxidant abilities of vitamin E can neutralize free radicals that are constantly reacting and damaging cellular DNA. Furthermore, it is also believed that free radical damage does contribute to protein damage in the ocular lens - another free radical-mediated condition that may potentially be prevented by vitamin E use. Where it is also suggested that various central nervous system disorders like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, and Tardive Dyskinesia possess some form of oxidative stress component, it is also proposed that perhaps vitamin E use could assist with its antioxidant action.There have also been studies that report the possibility of vitamin E supplementation can improve or reverse the natural decline in cellular immune function in healthy, elderly individuals.As of this time, however, there is either only insufficient data or even contradicting data (where certain doses of vitamin E supplementation could even potentially increase all-cause mortality)on which to suggest the use of vitamin E could formally benefit in any of these proposed indications.Furthermore, there are ongoing studies that demonstrate alpha-tocopherol succinate's unique possession of capabilities that allow it to induce differentiation, inhibit proliferation and apoptosis in cancer cells, enhance the growth-inhibitory effect of ionizing radiation, hyperthermia, and some chemotherapeutic agents and biological response modifiers on tumor cells, all the while protecting normal cells against any adverse effects. Despite being able to demonstrate such effects on animal and human cells in culture, the value of these effects has not drawn significant attention from researchers and clinicians and nor has the specific mechanisms of action been elucidated. Additionally, other studies have also shown that alpha-tocopherol succinate seemingly possesses an ability exclusive from other tocopherol esters to inhibit and minimize prostaglandin E production in human lung epithelial cells. Considering increased prostaglandin E production has been observed frequently in lung cancer patients, there may be another avenue in which alpha-tocopherol succinate may be able to treat lung cancer.

Increased contraction of this sphincter increases the pressure needed to produce an incontinence episode in stress urinary incontinence. Duloxetine has been shown to improve Patient Global Impression of Improvement and Incontinence Quality of Life scores.11It has also been shown to reduce the median incontinence episode frequency at doses of 40 and 80 mg.Action at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord allows duloxetine to strengthen the the serotonergic and adrenergic pathways involved in descending inhibition of pain.10,12This results in an increased threshold of activation necessary to transmit painful stimuli to the brain and effective relief of pain, particularly in neuropathic pain. Pain relief has been noted in a variety of painful conditions including diabetic peripheral neuropathy, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis using a range of pain assessment surveys.13While duloxetine has been shown to be effective in both animal models of mood disorders and in clinical trials for the treatment of these disorders in humans, the broad scope of its pharmacodynamic effects on mood regulation in the brain has yet to be explained.14Increased blood pressure is a common side effect with duloxetine due to vasoconstriction mediated by the intended increase in norepinephrine signaling.Label,16",CNCC[C@H](OC1=CC=CC2=CC=CC=C12)C1=CC=CS1,"Duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake.Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors.Action on the external urinary sphincter is mediated via duloxetine's CNS effects. Increased serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf's nucleus leads to increased activation of -HT, -HT, and αadrenergic receptors.,-HTand αare both Gqcoupled and their activation increases the activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C (IP/PLC) pathway.This pathway leads to release of intracellular calcium stores, increasing intracellular calcium concentrations, and facilitating neuronal excitability. -HTfunctions as a ligand-gated sodium channel which allows sodium to flow into the neuron when activated. Increased flow of sodium into the neuron contributes to depolarization and activation of voltage gated channels involved in action potential generation. The combined action of these three receptors contributes to increased excitability of the pudendal motor nerve in response to glutamate.Also related to duloxetine's action at the spinal cord is its modulation of pain. Increasing the concentration of serotonin and norepinephrine in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord increases descending inhibition of pain through activation of -HTA, -HTB, -HTD, -HT, -HT, α-adrenergic, and α-adrenergic receptors.-HT, -HT, and α-adrenergic mediate neuronal activation as described above. The activated neuron in this case is the GABAergic inhibitory interneuron which synapses onto the nociceptive projection neuron to inhibit the transmission of painful stimuli to the brain. The -HTand αreceptors are Gi/Gocoupled and their activation leads to increased potassium current through inward rectifier channels and decreased adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A signaling which contributes to neuronal inhibition.,These inhibitory receptors are present on the projection neuron itself as well as the dorsal root ganglion which precedes it and serves to directly suppress the transmission of painful stimuli.The mechanisms involved in duloxetine's benefits in depression and anxiety have not been fully elucidated. Dysfunctional serotonin and norepinephrine signaling are thought to be involved and increases in the availability of these neurotransmitters at the synaptic cleft thought to mediate a therapeutic effect.It is postulated that the involvement of serotonin and norepinephrine in area responsible for emotional modulation such as the limbic system contributes to the effects in mood disorders specifically but this has yet to be confirmed.Duloxetine's hypertensive effect is related to its intended pharmacological effect. Increased availability of norepinephrine leads to activation of adrenergic receptors on the vascular endothelium. Since the action of αreceptors predominates, vasoconstriction results as the Gqcoupled receptor mediates calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to facilitate smooth muscle contraction.TargetActionsOrganismASodium-dependent serotonin transporterinhibitorHumansASodium-dependent noradrenaline transporterinhibitorHumansUSodium-dependent dopamine transporterinhibitorHumans",[],"['Agents producing tachycardia', 'Analgesics', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antidepressive Agents Indicated for Depression', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Combined Inhibitors of Serotonin/Norepinephrine Reuptake', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Hypoglycemia-Associated Agents', 'Membrane Transport Modulators', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotransmitter Uptake Inhibitors', 'Norepinephrine Uptake Inhibitors', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Psychoanaleptics', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors', 'Sensory System Agents', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Serotonin Agents', 'Serotonin and Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors', 'Serotonin Modulators', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'Thiophenes']"

DB00333,Methadone,Methadoneis an opioid analgesic indicated for management of severe pain that is not responsive to alternative treatments. Also used to aid in detoxification and maintenance treatment of opioid addiction.,"['P35372', 'Q05586', 'Q12879', 'Q13224', 'Q14957', 'O15399', 'Q8TCU5', 'O60391', 'P41143', 'P36544', 'P46098', 'P32297', 'P43681', 'P17787']","Overall, methadone's pharmacological actions result in analgesia, suppression of opioid withdrawal symptoms, sedation, miosis (through binding to receptors in the pupillary muscles), sweating, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting (via binding within the chemoreceptor trigger zone), and constipation. Like many basic drugs, methadone also enters mast cells and releases histamine by a non-immunological mechanism leading to flushing, pruritus, and urticaria, which can commonly be misattributed to an allergic reaction.Compared to other opioids, methadone has fewer active metabolites and therefore a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity. This means that higher doses needed to manage severe pain or addiction are less likely to result in delirium, hyperalgesia, or seizures.19,20Similar to morphine, both methadone isomers are 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists, although l-methadone produces greater inhibition than d-methadone.Methadone's effects are reversible by naloxone with a pA2 value similar to its antagonism of morphine.21,22,23Dependence and ToleranceAs with other opioids, tolerance and physical dependence may develop upon repeated administration of methadone and there is a potential for development of psychological dependence. Physical dependence and tolerance reflect the neuroadaptation of the opioid receptors to chronic exposure to an opioid and are separate and distinct from abuse and addiction. Tolerance, as well as physical dependence, may develop upon repeated administration of opioids, and are not by themselves evidence of an addictive disorder or abuse.Patients on prolonged therapy should be tapered gradually from the drug if it is no longer required for pain control. Withdrawal symptoms may occur following abrupt discontinuation of therapy or upon administration of an opioid antagonist. Some of the symptoms that may be associated with abrupt withdrawal of an opioid analgesic include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.21,22,23Cardiac Conduction EffectsLaboratory studies, both in vivo and in vitro, have demonstrated that methadone inhibits cardiac potassium channels and prolongs the QT interval. Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have been observed during treatment with methadone. These cases appear to be more commonly associated with, but not limited to, higher dose treatment (> 200 mg/day). Methadone should be administered with particular caution to patients already at risk for development of prolonged QT interval (e.g., cardiac hypertrophy, concomitant diuretic use, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). Careful monitoring is recommended when using methadone in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disease, those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction, and in other cases where history or physical exam suggest an increased risk of dysrhythmia.21,22,23Respiratory Depression and OverdoseSerious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of methadone. Patients should be
monitored for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of methadone or following a dose increase.Respiratory depression is of particular concern in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation. Methadone should be administered with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, and CNS depression or coma. In these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of methadone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Alternative, non-opioid analgesics should be considered, and methadone should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose.Infants exposed in-utero or through breast milk are at risk of life-threatening respiratory depression upon delivery or when nursed.Methadone's peak respiratory depressant effects typically occur later, and persist longer than its peak analgesic effects, in the short-term use setting. These characteristics can contribute to cases of iatrogenic overdose, particularly during treatment initiation and dose titration.21,22,23Head Injury and Increased Intracranial PressureThe respiratory depressant effects of opioids and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce effects which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. In such patients, methadone must be used with caution, and only if it is deemed essential.21,22,23Incomplete Cross-tolerance between Methadone and other OpioidsPatients tolerant to other opioids may be incompletely tolerant to methadone. Incomplete cross-tolerance is of particular concern for patients tolerant to other µ-opioid agonists who are being converted to methadone, thus making the determination of dosing during opioid conversion complex. Deaths have been reported during conversion from chronic, high-dose treatment with other opioid agonists. A high degree of “opioid tolerance” does not eliminate the possibility of methadone overdose, iatrogenic or otherwise.21,22,23Crosstolerance between morphine and methadone has been demonstrated, as steady-state plasma methadone concentrations required for effectiveness (C50%) were higher in abstinent rats previously dosed with morphine, as compared to controls.Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of OpioidsMethadone is a mu-agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Methadone, like morphine and other opioids used for analgesia, has the potential for being abused and is subject to criminal diversion.Methadone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when dispensing Methadone in situations where the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.21,22,23Hypotensive EffectThe administration of methadone may result in severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain normal blood pressure is compromised (e.g., severe volume depletion).21,22,23Gastrointestinal EffectsMethadone and other morphine-like opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility and cause constipation. This primarily occurs through agonism of opioid receptors in the gut wall. Methadone may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.21,22,23Sexual Function/ReproductionReproductive function in human males may be decreased by methadone treatment. Reductions in ejaculate volume and seminal vesicle and prostate secretions have been reported in methadone-treated individuals. In addition, reductions in serum testosterone levels and sperm motility, and abnormalities in sperm morphology have been reported. Long-term use of opioids may be associated with decreased sex hormone levels and symptoms such as low libido, erectile dysfunction, or infertility.21,22,23",CCC(=O)C(CC(C)N(C)C)(C1=CC=CC=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1,"Methadone is a synthetic opioid analgesic with full agonist activity at the µ-opioid receptor. While agonism of the µ-opioid receptor is the primary mechanism of action for the treatment of pain, methadone also acts as an agonist of κ- and σ-opioid receptors within the central and peripheral nervous systems. Interestingly, methadone differs frommorphine(which is considered the gold standard reference opioid) in its antagonism of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and its strong inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake, which likely also contributes to its antinociceptive activity.Methadone is administered as a : racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-stereoisomers, with (R)-methadone demonstrating ~-fold higher affinity and potency for the µ-opioid receptor than the (S) stereoisomer.The analgesic activity of the racemate is almost entirely due to the (R)-isomer, while the (S)-isomer lacks significant respiratory depressant activity but does have antitussive effects.While methadone shares similar effects and risks of other opioids such asmorphine,hydromorphone,oxycodone, andfentanylit has a number of unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that distinguish it from them and make it a useful agent for the treatment of opioid addiction. For example, methadone abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe.TargetActionsOrganismAMu-type opioid receptoragonistHumansANMDA receptorantagonistHumansADelta-type opioid receptoragonistHumansANeuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-agonistHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor AantagonistHumansUNeuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-antagonistHumansUNeuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-antagonistHumansUNeuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit beta-antagonistHumans","['Opioid Detoxification', 'Maintenance therapy']","['Analgesics', 'Anticholinergic Agents', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antitussive Agents', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C18 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Diphenylpropylamine Derivatives', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Drugs Used in Addictive Disorders', 'Drugs Used in Opioid Dependence', 'High-risk opioids', 'Ketones', 'Moderate Risk QTc-Prolonging Agents', 'Narcotics', 'Nervous System', 'Nicotinic Antagonists', 'NMDA Receptor Antagonists', 'Opiate Agonists', 'Opioid Agonist', 'Opioids', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'QTc Prolonging Agents', 'Respiratory System Agents', 'Sensory System Agents', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Serotonin Agents', 'Serotonin Modulators', 'Thyroxine-binding globulin inducers']"

With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to the block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present10,7. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded10,7.In particular, such cardiac effects are likely associated with the principal effect that lidocaine elicits when it binds and blocks sodium channels, inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of electrical action potential impulses necessary to facilitate muscle contraction10,7,8. Subsequently, in cardiac myocytes, lidocaine can potentially block or otherwise slow the rise of cardiac action potentials and their associated cardiac myocyte contractions, resulting in possible effects like hypotension, bradycardia, myocardial depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and perhaps cardiac arrest or circulatory collapse10,7,8.Moreover, lidocaine possesses a dissociation constant (pKa) of 7.7 and is considered a weak base8. As a result, about 25% of lidocaine molecules will be un-ionized and available at the physiological pH of 7.4 to translocate inside nerve cells, which means lidocaine elicits an onset of action more rapidly than other local anesthetics that have higher pKa values8. This rapid onset of action is demonstrated in about one minute following intravenous injection and fifteen minutes following intramuscular injection7. The administered lidocaine subsequently spreads rapidly through the surrounding tissues and the anesthetic effect lasts approximately ten to twenty minutes when given intravenously and about sixty to ninety minutes after intramuscular injection7.Nevertheless, it appears that the efficacy of lidocaine may be minimized in the presence of inflammation8. This effect could be due to acidosis decreasing the amount of un-ionized lidocaine molecules, a more rapid reduction in lidocaine concentration as a result of increased blood flow, or potentially also because of increased production of inflammatory mediators like peroxynitrite that elicit direct actions on sodium channels8.",CCN(CC)CC(=O)NC1=C(C)C=CC=C1C,"Lidocaine is a local anesthetic of the amide type,,. It is used to provide local anesthesia by nerve blockade at various sites in the body,,. It does so by stabilizing the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action,,. In particular, the lidocaine agent acts on sodium ion channels located on the internal surface of nerve cell membranes,,. At these channels, neutral uncharged lidocaine molecules diffuse through neural sheaths into the axoplasm where they are subsequently ionized by joining with hydrogen ions,,. The resultant lidocaine cations are then capable of reversibly binding the sodium channels from the inside, keeping them locked in an open state that prevents nerve depolarization,,. As a result, with sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will ultimately not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential,,.

Meperidine has more affinity for the kappa-receptor than morphine. Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP and OP receptor agonist).

The indistinct release of neurotransmitters which include adrenaline is known to produce cardiovascular side effects.5There are old reports of a cognitive enhancement related to the administration of amphetamine in which improvements in intelligence test scores were reported.2In ADHD, amphetamine has been largely showed to produce remarkable improvements in school performance, behavior, and demeanor.1The effect was shown to be produced through both racemic forms and to this date, the use of racemic forms 3:1 (D:L) is very common.3The therapeutic effect of amphetamine on serotonin does not seem to have a significant clinical effect on ADHD as observed on comparative studies with amphetamine and fenfluramine, a powerful serotonin releasing factor. However, the indirect effect on serotonin might have an effect on the depression and anxiety profile of ADHD.6Studies regarding the illicit use of amphetamine in which heavy consumers were studied proved the generation of a paranoid state which flagged this drug as a psychiatric danger compound.13This observation was supported by the continuous reports of misuse in patients under depression.1",CC(N)CC1=CC=CC=C1,"It is important to consider that amphetamine has a very similar structure to the catecholamine neurotransmitters mainly on the presence of a long planar conformation, the presence of an aromatic ring and nitrogen in the aryl side chain. Amphetamine, as well as other catecholamines, is taken into presynaptic nerve terminals by the association with two sodium ions and one chloride ion. The complex of the amphetamine with the ions is actively transported by monoamine reuptake transporters. As amphetamine acts competitively with the endogenous monoamines, the greater the number of amphetamines the more internalized amphetamine will be found.Once inside the presynaptic terminal, amphetamine displaces other monoamines to be stored by VMAT which produces the pumping of the neurotransmitters into the synapse by a process called retro-transport.This process of release of neurotransmitters is approximately fourfold more potent in the d-isomer for the release of dopamine.The mechanism of action of amphetamine is complemented by the inhibition of the reuptake and of monoamine oxidase which acts synergistically to produce a significant increase the monoamine concentration.This activity is not done as an inhibitor per se but more as a competitive substrate and thus, amphetamine is known to be a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor, moderate noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor and very weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor. From this specific action, the l-isomer is known to be significantly less potent.Lastly, amphetamine is known to be an inhibitor of the mitochondrial-bound enzyme MAO which is the catalytic enzyme in charge of degrading all the excess of neurotransmitters. This mechanism of action is often overpassed as amphetamine is a weak MAO inhibitor but this mechanism cannot be dismissed.TargetActionsOrganismASynaptic vesicular amine transporterinhibitorHumansASodium-dependent dopamine transporternegative modulatorHumansACocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript proteinagonistHumansATrace amine-associated receptor agonistHumansAMonoamine oxidaseinhibitorHumansAvesicular monoamine transporter  (VMAT)Not AvailableHumansUSodium-dependent noradrenaline transporteragonistsubstrateHumansUAlpha adrenergic receptoragonistHumansUBeta adrenergic receptoragonistHumansUDopamine D receptorbinderHumansUAmine oxidase [flavin-containing] BinhibitorHumansUSodium-dependent serotonin transporterbinderHumans",[],"['Adrenergic Agents', 'Agents producing tachycardia', 'Agents that produce hypertension', 'Agents that reduce seizure threshold', 'Amines', 'Amphetamines', 'Autonomic Agents', 'Benzene Derivatives', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Biogenic Monoamines', 'Catechols', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Stimulants', 'Central Nervous System Stimulation', 'Centrally Acting Sympathomimetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Membrane Transport Modulators', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'Neurotransmitter Uptake Inhibitors', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Phenethylamines', 'Phenols', 'Psychoanaleptics', 'Psychostimulants, Agents Used for ADHD and Nootropics', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Sympathomimetics']"

Current knowledge suggests that levetiracetam’s binding to synaptic vesicle protein A (SVA) is a key driver of its action. SVA is a membrane-bound protein that is found on synaptic vesicles and is ubiquitous throughout the CNS- it appears to play a role in vesicle exocytosis,and in the modulation of synaptic transmission by increasing the available amount of secretory vesicles available for neurotransmission.Stimulation of pre-synaptic SVA by levetiracetam may inhibit neurotransmitter release,but this action does not appear to affect normal neurotransmission. This has led to the suggestion that levetiracetam exclusively modulates the function of SVA only under pathophysiological conditions.Levetiracetam and related analogues showed a correlation between affinity for SVA and anti-epileptic potency, further suggesting that action at this site contributes to the anti-epileptic activity of the drug.,Levetiracetam has also been shown to indirectly affect GABAergic neurotransmission (despite having no direct effect on GABAergic or glutamatergic receptors) and modulate ionic currents.Similarly, levetiracetam has been shown in vitro to inhibit N-type calcium channels.How, or even if, these actions are implicated in its anti-epileptic action have yet to be elucidated.TargetActionsOrganismAVoltage-dependent N-type calcium channel subunit alpha-BinhibitorHumansASynaptic vesicle glycoprotein AagonistHumans",[],"['Acetamides', 'Amides', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Decreased Central Nervous System Disorganized Electrical Activity', 'Miscellaneous Anticonvulsants', 'Nervous System', 'P-glycoprotein substrates', 'Pyrrolidines', 'Pyrrolidinones']"

Renin acts on the precursor prottein angiotensinogen, which is a plasma globulin synthesized from the liver, to produce cleaved peptide hormone angiotensin I.Angiotensin I then can be further cleaved by ACE to produce angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictive peptide hormone.LabelPresent in different isoforms, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is peptidyl dipeptidase enzyme expressed in various tissues, including the vascular tissues, such as the heart, brain, and kidneys.ACE also plays a role in inactivation of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide.,LabelAngiotensin II mediates various actions on the body by working on its G-protein coupled receptors, AT and AT.It causes direct vasoconstriction of precapillary arterioles and postcapillary venules, inhibits the reuptake of NE thereby increasing available levels, stimulates the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, reduces urinary excretion of sodium ions and water by promoting proximal tubular reabsorption, stimulates synthesis and release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, and stimulates hypertrophy of both vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes.Enalapril is a pharmacologically inactive prodrug that requires hepatic biotransformation to formenalaprilat, its active metabolite that works on the RAAS to inhibit ACE.LabelBiotransformation is critial for the therapeutic actions of the drug, as enalapril itself is only a weak inhibitor of ACE.ACE inhibition results in reduced production and plasma levels of angiotensin II, increased plasma renin activity due to the loss of feedback inhibition by angiotensin II, and decreased aldosterone secretion.However, plasma aldosterone levels usually return to normal during long-term administration of enalapril.Decreased levels of angiotensin II subsequently leads to the dilatation of peripheral vessles and reduced vascular resistance which in turn lower blood pressure.While inhibition of ACE leading to suppression of RAAS is thought to be the primary mechanism of action of enalapril, the drug was shown to still exert antihypertensive effects on individuals with low-renin hypertension. It is suggested that enalapril may mediate its pharmacological actions via other modes of action that are not fully understood.LabelAs ACE is structurally similar to kininase I, which is a carboxypeptidase that degrades bradykinin, whether increased levels of bradykinin play a role in the therapeutic effects of enalapril remains to be elucidated.LabelTargetActionsOrganismAAngiotensin-converting enzymeinhibitorHumans",[],"['ACE Inhibitors and Calcium Channel Blockers', 'ACE Inhibitors and Diuretics', 'Agents Acting on the Renin-Angiotensin System', 'Agents causing angioedema', 'Agents causing hyperkalemia', 'Agents Causing Muscle Toxicity', 'Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents Indicated for Hypertension', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Decreased Blood Pressure', 'Dipeptides', 'Drugs causing inadvertant photosensitivity', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'OAT1/SLC22A6 inhibitors', 'OAT3/SLC22A8 Inhibitors', 'OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Substrates', 'Oligopeptides', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'Peptides', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Protease Inhibitors']"

It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.3,4Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.3Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.6,7,8,9,10Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.3,4Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.11,12Skeletal Muscle EffectsSimvastatin occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (≥65 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Chinese patients may also be at increased risk for myopathy. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued.29,30In a clinical trial database of 41,413 patients, the incidence of myopathy was approximately 0.03% and 0.08% at 20 and 40 mg/day, respectively, while the risk of myopathy with simvastatin 80 mg (0.61%) was disproportionately higher than that observed at the lower doses. It's therefore recommended that the 80mg dose of simvastatin should be used only in patients who have been taking simvastatin 80 mg chronically (e.g., for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity. As well, patients already stabilized on simvastatin 80mg should be monitored closely for evidence of muscle toxicity; if they need to be initiated on an interacting drug that is contraindicated or is associated with a dose cap for simvastatin, that patient should be switched to an alternative statin with less potential for the drug-drug interaction.29,30The risk of myopathy during treatment with simvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such asfenofibrate,niacin,gemfibrozil,cyclosporine, and strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme. Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered withcolchicine, and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.29,30Liver Enzyme AbnormalitiesPersistent increases (to more than 3X the ULN) in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 1% of patients who received simvastatin in clinical studies. When drug treatment was interrupted or discontinued in these patients, the transaminase levels usually fell slowly to pretreatment levels. The increases were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms.29,30In the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S),14the number of patients with more than one transaminase elevation to >3 times the ULN, over the course of the study, was not significantly different between the simvastatin and placebo groups (14 [0.7%] vs. 12 [0.6%]). The frequency of single elevations of ALT to 3 times the ULN was significantly higher in the simvastatin group in the first year of the study (20 vs. 8, p=0.023), but not thereafter. In the HPS (Heart Protection Study),10in which 20,536 patients were randomized to receive simvastatin 40 mg/day or placebo, the incidences of elevated transaminases (>3X ULN confirmed by repeat test) were 0.21% (n=21) for patients treated with simvastatin and 0.09% (n=9) for patients treated with placebo.29,30Endocrine EffectsIncreases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including simvastatin.29Although cholesterol is the precursor of all steroid hormones, studies with simvastatin have suggested that this agent has no clinical effect on steroidogenesis. Simvastatin caused no increase in biliary lithogenicity and, therefore, would not be expected to increase the incidence of gallstones.30",[H][C@]12[C@H](C[C@@H](C)C=C1C=C[C@H](C)[C@@H]2CC[C@@H]1C[C@@H](O)CC(=O)O1)OC(=O)C(C)(C)CC,"Simvastatin is a prodrug in which the -membered lactone ring of simvastatin is hydrolyzedin vivoto generate the beta,delta-dihydroxy acid, an active metabolite structurally similar to HMG-CoA (hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA). Once hydrolyzed, simvastatin competes with HMG-CoA for HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic microsomal enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.Simvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Simvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).,The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL.At therapeutic doses, the HMG-CoA enzyme is not completely blocked by simvastatin activity, thereby allowing biologically necessary amounts of mevalonate to remain available. As mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol, therapy with simvastatin would also not be expected to cause any accumulation of potentially toxic sterols. In addition, HMG-CoA is metabolized readily back to acetyl-CoA, which participates in many biosynthetic processes in the body.In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that simvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β integrin function-associated antigen- (LFA-), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.TargetActionsOrganismA-hydroxy--methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductaseinhibitorHumansUIntegrin alpha-Linhibitory allosteric modulatorHumansUHistone deacetylase inhibitorHumans",[],"['Agents Causing Muscle Toxicity', 'Anticholesteremic Agents', 'BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs causing inadvertant photosensitivity', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Hypolipidemic Agents', 'Hypolipidemic Agents Indicated for Hyperlipidemia', 'Lipid Modifying Agents', 'Lipid Modifying Agents, Plain', 'Lipid Regulating Agents', 'Naphthalenes', 'Noxae', 'OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors', 'OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Substrates', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'P-glycoprotein substrates', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'UGT1A1 Substrates', 'UGT1A3 substrates', 'UGT2B7 substrates']"

With high affinity, GHB binds to excitatory GHB receptors that are densely expressed throughout the brain, including the cotex and hippocampus. There is some evidence in research that upon activation of GHB receptors in some brain areas, the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is released. GHB stimulates dopamin release at low concentrations by acting on the GHB receptor, and the release of dopamine occurs in a biphasic manner. At higher concentrations, GHB inhibits dopamine release by acting on the GABA-B receptors, which is followed by GHB receptor signaling and increased release of dopamine. This explains the paradoxical mix of sedative and stimulatory properties of GHB, as well as the so-called ""rebound"" effect, experienced by individuals using GHB as a sleeping agent, wherein they awake suddenly after several hours of GHB-induced deep sleep.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) protects hepatocytes and cholangiocytes from bile acid-induced damage, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction.UDCA was shown to reserve hepatocyte cell structures and stimulate anti-apoptotic pathways.,,,It was also shown to prevent the production of ROS by Kupffer cells and resident macrophages in the liver, thus attenuating oxidative stress in the liver.UDCA can also change the hydrophobicity index of the bile acid pool: following oral administration, UDCA forms a major fraction of the human bile acid pool and competitively displaces the hydrophobic or more toxic bile acids.,It increases the absorption of hydrophilic bile acids.There are several proposed mechanisms of choleretic actions of UDCA: UDCA increases intracellular calcium levels, stimulating transport proteins and vesicular exocytosis in cholestatic hepatocytes.UDCA may also upregulate the expression of membrane transport proteins like the chloride-bicarbonate anion exchanger (AE),,which is involved in biliary secretion and is often observed to be defective in primary biliary cholangitis.In rats, UDCA reduced hepatic expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens, suggesting immunomodulating effects.UDCA acts as a partial agonist at the bile acid receptor, also known as the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and has negligible effects on cholesterol and lipid synthesis.TargetActionsOrganismAAldo-keto reductase family  member CinhibitorHumansUBile acid receptorpartial agonistHumans",[],"['Alimentary Tract and Metabolism', 'Bile Acid Preparations', 'Bile acids and derivatives', 'Bile Acids and Salts', 'Bile and Liver Therapy', 'Bile Therapy', 'BSEP/ABCB11 inducers', 'BSEP/ABCB11 Inhibitors', 'BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates', 'Cholagogues and Choleretics', 'Cholanes', 'Cholelitholytic Agents', 'Cholic Acids', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Fused-Ring Compounds', 'Gastrointestinal Agents', 'Steroids']"

Copper ions are known to reduce fertility when released from copper-containing IUDs3.,[Cu],"Copper is absorbed from the gut via high affinity copper uptake protein and likely through low affinity copper uptake protein and natural resistance-associated macrophage protein-. It is believed that copper is reduced to the Cu+ form prior to transport. Once inside the enterocyte, it is bound to copper transport protein ATOX which shuttles the ion to copper transporting ATPase- on the golgi membrane which take up copper into the golgi apparatus. Once copper has been secreted by enterocytes into the systemic circulation it remain largely bound by ceruloplasmin (-%), albumin (%), and alpha -macroglobulin (%).Copper is an essential element in the body and is incorporated into many oxidase enzymes as a cofactor. It is also a component of zinc/copper super oxide dismutase, giving it an anti-oxidant role. Copper defiency occurs in Occipital Horn Syndrome and Menke's disease both of which are associated with impaired development of connective tissue due to the lack of copper to act as a cofactor in protein-lysine--oxidase. Menke's disease is also associated with progressive neurological impairment leading to death in infancy. The precise mechanisms of the effects of copper deficiency are vague due to the wide range of enzymes which use the ion as a cofactor.Copper appears to reduce the viabilty and motility of spermatozoa. This reduces the likelihood of fertilization with a copper IUD, producing copper's contraceptive effect. The exact mechanism of copper's effect on sperm are unknown.TargetActionsOrganismUAmyloid beta A proteinbinderHumansUAdenosylhomocysteinaseallosteric modulatorHumansUHistone HB type -C/E/F/G/INot

Verapamil binds to these channels in a voltage- and frequency-dependent manner, meaning affinity is increased ) as vascular smooth muscle membrane potential is reduced, and ) with excessive depolarizing stimulus.Verapamil's mechanism of action in the treatment of angina and hypertension is likely due to the mechanism described above. Inhibition of calcium influx prevents the contraction of vascular smooth muscle, causing relaxation/dilation of blood vessels throughout the peripheral circulation - this lowers systemic vascular resistance (i.e. afterload) and thus blood pressure. This reduction in vascular resistance also reduces the force against which the heart must push, decreasing myocardial energy consumption and oxygen requirements and thus alleviating angina.Electrical activity through the AV node is responsible for determining heart rate, and this activity is dependent upon calcium influx through L-type calcium channels. By inhibiting these channels and decreasing the influx of calcium, verapamil prolongs the refractory period of the AV node and slows conduction, thereby slowing and controlling the heart rate in patients with arrhythmia.Verapamil's mechanism of action in the treatment of cluster headaches is unclear, but is thought to result from an effect on other calcium channels (e.g. N-, P-, Q-, or T-type).Verapamil is known to interact with other targets, including other calcium channels,,,,potassium channels,,,and adrenergic receptors.,TargetActionsOrganismAVoltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit alpha-CinhibitorHumansUVoltage-dependent N-type calcium channel subunit alpha-BinhibitorHumansUVoltage-dependent P/Q-type calcium channel subunit alpha-AinhibitorHumansUATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel inhibitorHumansUVoltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-GinhibitorHumansUVoltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-HinhibitorHumansUPotassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member inhibitorHumansUSodium-dependent serotonin transporterunknownHumansUAlpha-A adrenergic receptorantagonistHumansUAlpha-B adrenergic receptorantagonistHumansUAlpha-D adrenergic receptorantagonistHumansUVoltage-dependent calcium channelinhibitorHumansUP-glycoprotein inhibitorblockerHumans",[],"['ACE Inhibitors and Calcium Channel Blockers', 'Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists', 'Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists', 'Adrenergic Antagonists', 'Amines', 'Antiarrhythmic agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents Indicated for Hypertension', 'Bradycardia-Causing Agents', 'Calcium Channel Blockers', 'Calcium Channel Blockers (Nondihydropyridine)', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C18 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'MATE 1 Inhibitors', 'MATE 2 Inhibitors', 'MATE inhibitors', 'Membrane Transport Modulators', 'Miscellaneous Calcium-channel Blocking Agents', 'Negative Inotrope', 'OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors', 'OCT1 inhibitors', 'OCT1 substrates', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'P-glycoprotein substrates', 'Phenylalkylamine Derivatives', 'Selective Calcium Channel Blockers With Direct Cardiac Effects', 'Vasodilating Agents', 'Verapamil and analogues']"

It decreases low density lipoproteins and increases high density lipoproteins. Bezafibrate lowers elevated blood lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol). Elevated VLDL and LDL are reduced by treatment with bezafibrate, whilst HDL-levels are increased. The activity of triglyceride lipases (lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipoproteinlipase) involved in the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is increased by bezafibrate. In the course of the intensified degradation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons, VLDL) precursors for the formation of HDL are formed which explains an increase in HDL. Furthermore, cholesterol biosynthesis is reduced by bezafibrate, which is accompanied by a stimulation of the LDL-receptor-mediated lipoprotein catabolism. Elevated fibrinogen appears to be an important risk-factor, alongside the lipids, smoking and hypertension, in the development of atheroma. Fibrinogen plays an important role in viscosity, and therefore blood flow, and also appears to play an important role in thrombus development and lysability. Bezafibrate exerts an effect on thrombogenic factors. A significant decrease in elevated plasma fibrinogen levels can be achieved.

Ramiprilat confers blood pressure lowing effects by antagonizing the effect of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain the effects of ramiprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.",[H][C@@]12CCC[C@]1([H])N([C@@H](C2)C(O)=O)C(=O)[C@H](C)N[C@@H](CCC1=CC=CC=C1)C(=O)OCC,"Ramipril inhibits the RAAS system by binding to and inhibiting ACE thereby preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.As plasma levels of angiotensin II fall, less activation of the G-protein coupled receptors angiotensin receptor I (ATR) and angiotensin receptor II (ATR) occurs.ATR mediates vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress through a variety of signaling pathways.These include Gqcoupling to the inositol triphosphate pathway, activation of phospholipases C, A, and D which contribute to eicosanoid production, activation of Ca+-dependent and MAP kinases, Giand G/, and eventual activation of the Jak/STAT pathway leading to cell growth and production of extracellular matrix components. ATR activation also leads to increased activity of membrane-bound NADH/NADPH oxidase which contributes to production of reactive oxygen species. Decreased activation of this receptor mediates the renoprotective, antihypertensive, and cardioprotective effects of ramipril by reducing inflammation and vasoconstriction.ATR acts in opposition to the effects of ATR by activating phosphotyrosine phosphatases which inhibit MAP kinases, inhibiting Ca+channel opening, and stimulating cGMP and nitric oxide production leading to vasodilation.These counteracting effects are shared by the Mas receptor which is activated by Ang(-), a subtype of angiotensin produced by plasma esterases from AngI or by ACE from AngII produced through a secondary pathway by tonin and cathepsin G. Ang(-) also activates ATR although the bulk of its effect is mediated by MasR.ACE is also responsible for the breakdown of bradykinin.The resulting buildup of bradykinin due to ACE inhibition is thought to mediate the characteristic dry-cough as a side effect of ACE inhibitor medications.TargetActionsOrganismAAngiotensin-converting enzymeinhibitorHumansUB bradykinin receptorNot AvailableHumans",[],"['ACE Inhibitors and Calcium Channel Blockers', 'ACE Inhibitors and Diuretics', 'Agents Acting on the Renin-Angiotensin System', 'Agents causing angioedema', 'Agents causing hyperkalemia', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents Indicated for Hypertension', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Drugs causing inadvertant photosensitivity', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'Lipid Modifying Agents', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Protease Inhibitors']"

Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke.It is important to note that there is % homology between the protein structures of COX- and COX-. ASA binds to serine  residue on the active site of COX- in the same fashion as its binding to the serine  residue located on the active site of COX-. The active site of COX- is, however, slightly larger than the active site of COX-, so that arachidonic acid (which later becomes prostaglandins) manages to bypass the aspirin molecule inactivating COX-,.

This response later declines to baseline with long-term use of atenolol. More importantly, this reduction in the work demanded of the myocardium also reduces oxygen demand which provides therapeutic benefit by reducing the mismatch of oxygen supply and demand in settings where coronary blood flow is limited, such as in coronary atherosclerosis. Reducing oxygen demand, particularly due to exercise, can reduce the frequency of angina pectoris symptoms and potentially improve survival of the remaining myocardium after myocardial infarction. The decrease in rate of sinoatrial node potentials, electrical conduction, slowing of potentials traveling through the atrioventricular node, and reduced frequency of ectopic potentials due to blockade of adrenergic beta receptors has led to benefit in arrhythmic conditions such as atrial fibrillation by controlling the rate of action potential generation and allowing for more effective coordinated contractions. Since a degree of sympathetic activity is necessary to maintain cardiac function, the reduced contractility induced by atenolol may precipitate or worsen heart failure, especially during volume overload.LabelThe effects of atenolol on blood pressure have been established, although it is less effective than alternative beta-blockers, but the mechanism has not yet been characterized.Label,24As a β1 selective drug, it does not act via the vasodilation produced by non-selective agents.24Despite this there is a sustained reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, and consequently blood pressure, alongside a decrease in cardiac output. It is thought that atenolol's antihypertensive activity may be related to action on the central nervous system (CNS) or it's inhibition of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system rather than direct effects on the vasculature.LabelAtenolol produces CNS effects similar to other beta-blockers, but does so to a lesser extent due to reduces ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.24It has the potential to produce fatigue, depression, and sleep disturbances such as nightmares or insomnia.Label,24The exact mechanisms behind these have not been characterized but their occurrence must be considered as they represent clinically relevant adverse effects.Atenolol exerts some effects on the respiratory system although to a much lesser extent than non-selective beta-blockers.LabelInteraction with β2 receptors in the airways can produce bronchoconstriction by blocking the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle mediated by the sympathetic nervous system.24The same action can interfere with β-agonist therapies used in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Label,14,24Unlike some other beta-blocker drugs, atenolol does not have intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity nor does it produce changes in glycemic control.Label",CC(C)NCC(O)COC1=CC=C(CC(N)=O)C=C1,"Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, called such because it selectively binds to the β-adrenergic receptor as an antagonist up to a reported  fold more than β receptors.Selective activity at the β receptor produces cardioselectivity due to the higher population of this receptor in cardiac tissue. Some binding to β and possibly β receptors can still occur at therapeutic dosages but the effects mediated by antagonizing these are significantly reduced from those of non-selective agents. β and β receptors are Gscoupled therefore antagonism of their activation reduces activity of adenylyl cyclase and its downstream signalling via cyclic adenosime monophosphate and protein kinase A (PKA).In cardiomyocytes PKA is thought to mediate activation of L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors through their phosphorylation.L-type calcium channels can then provide an initial rise in intracellular calcium and trigger the ryanodine receptors to release calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and increased contractility. PKA also plays a role in the cessation of contraction by phosphorylating phospholamban which in turn increases the affinity of SR Ca+ATPase to increase reuptake of calcium into the SR. It also phophorylates troponin I to reduce affinity of the protein for calcium. Both of these events lead to a reduction in contraction which, when coupled with the initial increase in contraction, allows for faster cycling and consequently higher heart rate with increased contractility. L-type calcium channels are also a major contributor to cardiac depolarization and their activation can increase frequency of action potentials and possibly the incidence of ectopic potentials.Similar inihibitory events occur in the bronchial smooth muscle to mediate relaxation including phosphorylation of myosin light-chain kinase, reducing its affinity for calcium.PKA also inhibits the excitatory Gqcoupled pathway by phosphorylating the inositol trisphosphate receptor and phospholipase C resulting in inhibition of intracellular calcium release. Antagonism of this activity by beta-blocker agents like atenolol can thus cause increased bronchoconstriction.TargetActionsOrganismABeta- adrenergic receptorantagonistHumansUBeta- adrenergic receptorantagonistHumans",[],"['Adrenergic Agents', 'Adrenergic Antagonists', 'Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Antagonists', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Agents causing hyperkalemia', 'Alcohols', 'Amines', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Antiarrhythmic agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents Indicated for Hypertension', 'Autonomic Agents', 'Beta blocking agents and calcium channel blockers', 'Beta Blocking Agents and Thiazides', 'Beta Blocking Agents, Selective', 'Beta Blocking Agents, Selective, and Thiazides', 'Beta-Blockers (Beta1 Selective)', 'Bradycardia-Causing Agents', 'BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'QTc shortening agents', 'Sympatholytics']"

Migraine attacks are generally divided into phases: the premonitory phase, which typically involves irritability, fatigue, yawning, and stiff neck; the headache phase, which lasts for between four and  hours; and the postdrome phase, which lasts for up to a day following resolution of pain and whose symptoms are similar to those of the premonitory phase. In addition, neurological deficits, collectively termed migraine aura, may precede the headache phase.,The underlying pathophysiology of migraines is a matter of active research but involves both neurological and vascular components. The head pain associated with migraine is thought to be a consequence of activation of the nociceptive nerves comprising the trigeminocervical complex (TCC).Terminals of nociceptive nerves that innervate the dura matter release vasoactive peptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), resulting in cranial vasodilation. Finally, when present, migraine aura appears to correlate with a transient wave(s) of cortical depolarization, termed cortical spreading depression (CSD).,Triptans, including zolmitriptan, are proposed to act in three ways. The main mechanism is through modulation of nociceptive nerve signalling in the central nervous system through -HTB/Dreceptors throughout the TCC and associated areas of the brain. In addition, triptans can enhance vasoconstriction, both through direct -HTB-mediated dilation of cranial blood vessels,,as well as through -HTD-mediated suppression of CGRP release.,Although triptans are classically described solely in terms of their effects on -HTB/Dreceptors, they also act as -HTFagonists as well.

DB00343,Diltiazem,Diltiazemis a calcium channel blocker used to treat hypertension and to manage chronic stable angina.,"['Q13936', 'Q06432']","Diltiazem is an antihypertensive and vasodilating agent that works by relaxing the vascular muscle and reducing blood pressure. This is related to the long-term therapeutic effects, as lowering the blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.12Diltiazem inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium ions across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes during depolarization. Diltiazem is classified as a negative inotrope (decreased force) and negative chronotrope (decreased rate).9It is also considered a rate-control drug as it reduces heart rate.2,8Diltiazem is exerts hemodynamic actions by reducing blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, the rate-pressure product, and coronary vascular resistance while increasing coronary blood flow.10Diltiazem decreases sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction in isolated tissues and has a negative inotropic effect in isolated preparations.12In supraventricular tachycardia, diltiazem prolongs AV nodal refractories.10As the magnitude of blood pressure reduction is related to the degree of hypertension, the antihypertensive effect of diltiazem is most pronounced in individuals with hypertension. In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-response study involving patients with essential hypertension, there was a reduction in the diastolic blood pressure by 1.9, 5.4, 6.1, and 8.6 mmHg in the patients receiving diltiazem at doses of 120, 240, 360, and 540 mg, respectively.

It is also thought that valproate exerts a neuroprotective effect preventing damage and neural degeneration in epilepsy, migraines, and bipolar disorder.Valproate is hepatotoxic and teratogenic. The reasons for this are unclear but have been attributed to the genomic effects of the drug.1A small proof-of concept study found that valproate increases clearance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) when combined with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) by reactivating the virus to allow clearance, however, a larger multicentre trial failed to show a significant effect on HIV reservoirs when added to HAART.2,6The FDA labeling contains a warning regarding HIV reactivation during valproate use.Label.",CCCC(CCC)C(O)=O,"The exact mechanisms by which valproate exerts it's effects on epilepsy, migraine headaches, and bipolar disorder are unknown however several pathways exist which may contribute to the drug's action.Valproate is known to inhibit succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase.This inhibition results in an increase in succinic semialdehyde which acts as an inhibitor of GABA transaminase ultimately reducing GABA metabolism and increasing GABAergic neurotransmission. As GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, this increase results in increased inhibitory activity.A possible secondary contributor to cortical inhibition is a direct suppression of voltage gated sodium channel activity and indirect suppression through effects on GABA.It has also been suggested that valproate impacts the extracellular signal-related kinase pathway (ERK).These effects appear to be dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and result in the phosphorylation of ERK/. This activation increases expression of several downstream targets including ELK- with subsequent increases in c-fos, growth cone-associated protein- which contributes to neural plasticity, B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia- which is an anti-apoptotic protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is also involved in neural plasticity and growth. Increased neurogenesis and neurite growth due to valproate are attributed to the effects of this pathway. An additional downstream effect of increased BDNF expression appears to be an increase in GABAAreceptors which contribute further to increased GABAergic activity.Valproate exerts a non-competitive indirect inhibitory effect on myo-inosital--phophate synthetase.This results in reduced de novo synthesis of inositol monophosphatase and subsequent inositol depletion. It is unknown how this contributed to valproate's effects on bipolar disorder but [lithium] is known to exert a similar inositol-depleting effect.Valproate exposure also appears to produce down-regulation of protein kinase C proteins (PKC)-α and -ε which are potentially related to bipolar disorder as PKC is unregulated in the frontal cortex of bipolar patients. This is further supported by a similar reduction in PKC with lithium.The inhibition of the PKC pathway may also be a contributor to migraine prophylaxis.Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, a PKC substrate, is also downregulated by valproate and may contribute to changes in synaptic remodeling through effects on the cytoskeleton.Valproate also appears to impact fatty acid metabolism.Less incorporation of fatty acid substrates in sterols and glycerolipids is thought to impact membrane fluidity and result in increased action potential threshold potentially contributing to valproate's antiepileptic action.Valproate has been found to be a non-competitive direct inhibitor of brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase.Inhibition of this enzyme decreases available arichidonyl-CoA, a substrate in the production of inflammatory prostaglandins. It is thought that this may be a mechanism behind valproate's efficacy in migraine prophylaxis as migraines are routinely treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which also inhibit prostaglandin production.Finally, valproate acts as a direct histone deactylase (HDAC) inhibitor.Hyperacetylation of lysine residues on histones promoted DNA relaxation and allows for increased gene transcription. The scope of valproate's genomic effects is wide with  genes being up or down-regulated.The relation of these genomic effects to therapeutic value is not fully characterized however H and H hyperacetylation correlates with improvement of symptoms in bipolar patients.Histone hyperacetylation at the BDNF gene, increasing BDNF expression, post-seizure is known to occur and is thought to be a neuroprotective mechanism which valproate may strengthen or prolong.H hyperacetylation is associated with a reduction in glyceraldehyde--phosphate dehydrogenase, a pro-apoptotic enzyme, contributing further to valproate's neuroprotective effects.TargetActionsOrganismAHistone deacetylase inhibitorHumansUShort/branched chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, mitochondrialinhibitorHumansU-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, mitochondrialinhibitorHumansUSuccinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, mitochondrialinhibitorHumansUSodium channel proteininhibitorHumansUHistone deacetylase inhibitorHumansUPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alphaNot AvailableHumansUPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor deltaNot AvailableHumansUPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gammaNot AvailableHumansUHistone deacetylaseinhibitorHumansUCyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor regulatorHumansUHepatocyte growth factorinhibitorHumansUOrnithine decarboxylasedownregulatorHumansUProgrammed cell death  ligand downregulatorHumans",[],"['Acids, Acyclic', 'Anti-epileptic Agent', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Antimanic Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Decreased Central Nervous System Disorganized Electrical Activity', 'Drugs causing inadvertant photosensitivity', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Fatty Acid Derivatives', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Acids, Volatile', 'GABA Agents', 'Hepatotoxic Agents', 'Highest Risk QTc-Prolonging Agents', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Lipids', 'Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents', 'Miscellaneous Anticonvulsants', 'Mood Stabilizer', 'Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'OAT1/SLC22A6 inhibitors', 'OAT3/SLC22A8 Inhibitors', 'OAT3/SLC22A8 Substrates', 'OAT3/SLC22A8 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2B1 Inhibitors', 'Pentanoic Acids', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'QTc Prolonging Agents', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Tranquilizing Agents', 'UGT1A1 Inhibitors', 'UGT1A1 Substrates', 'UGT1A1 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'UGT1A3 substrates', 'UGT1A3 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'UGT1A4 substrates', 'UGT1A6 substrate', 'UGT1A6 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'UGT1A9 Substrates', 'UGT1A9 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'UGT2B7 substrates', 'UGT2B7 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Valerates']"

Inhibition of this enzyme is responsible for the effects of allopurinol. This drug increases the reutilization of hypoxanthine and xanthine for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis by a process that involves the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase). This process results in an increased nucleotide concentration, which causes feedback inhibition of de novo purine synthesis. The end result is decreased urine and serum uric acid concentrations, which decreases the incidence of gout symptoms.Accompanying the reduction of serum uric acid by allopurinol is an increase in the serum and urine concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine (due to inhibition of xanthine oxidase). In the absence of allopurinol, regular urinary excretion of oxypurines almost entirely occurs in the form of uric acid. After the ingestion of allopurinol, the contents of excreted urine are hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid. Because each substance has its own individual solubility, the concentration of uric acid in plasma is decreased without exposing the renal tissues to a high load of uric acid, thereby decreasing the risk of crystalluria.

Thrombi due to venous thrombosis can travel to the lungs and become pulmonary emboli, blocking circulation to a portion of lung tissue. Thrombi which form in the heart can travel to the brain and cause ischemic strokes. Prevention of these events is the primary goal of warfarin therapy.Limitation of thrombus formation is also a source of adverse effects. In patients with atheroscelotic plaques rupture typically results in thrombus formation.11When these patients are anticoagulated plaque rupture can allow the escape of cholesterol from the lipid core in the form of atheroemboli or cholesterol microemboli. These emboli are smaller than thrombi and block smaller vessels, usually less than 200 μm in diameter. The consequences of this are varied and depend on the location of the blockage. Effects include visual disturbances, acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease, central nervous system ischemia, and purple or blue toe syndrome.Label,11Blue toe syndrome can be reversed if it has not progressed to tissue necrosis but the other effects of microemboli are often permanent.Antocoagulation appears to mediate warfarin-related nephropathy, a seemingly spontaneous kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease associated with warfarin therapy.12Nephropathy in this case appears to be due to increased passage of red blood cells through the glomerulus and subsequent blockage of renal tubules with red blood cell casts. This is worsened or possibly triggered by pre-existing kidney damage. Increased risk of warfarin-related nephropathy occurs at INRs over 3.0 but risk does not increase as a function of INR beyond this point.Warfarin has been linked to the development of calciphylaxis.LabelThis is thought to be due to warfarin's inhibition ofvitamin Krecycling as VKA is needed for the carboxylation of matrix Gla protein.13This protein is an anti-calcification factor and its inhibition through preventing the carboxylation step in its production leads to a shift in calcification balance in favor of calciphylaxis.Tissue necrosis can occur early on in warfarin therapy.LabelThis is attributable to half lives of the clotting factors impacted by inhibition of vitamin K recycling.Label,14Proteins C and S are anticoagulation factors with half lives of 8 and 24 hours respectively. The coagulation factors IX, X, VII, and thrombin (factor II) have half lives of 24, 36, 6, and 50 hours respectively. This means proteins C and S are inactivated sooner than pro-coagulation proteins, with the exception of factor VII, resulting in a pro-thrombotic state for the first few days of therapy. Thrombi which form in this time period can occlude arterioles in various locations, blocking blood flow and causing tissue necrosis due to ischemia.",CC(=O)CC(C1=CC=CC=C1)C1=C(O)C2=C(OC1=O)C=CC=C2,"Warfarin is a [vitamin K] antagonist which acts to inhibit the production of vitamin K by vitamin K epoxide reductase.Label,,The reduced form of vitamin K, vitamin KHis a cofactor used in the γ-carboxylation of coagulation factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin.

Uncarboxylated factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin are biologically inactive and therefore serve to interrupt the coagulation cascade.

This is particularly true in the case of thrombin which must be activated in order to form a thrombus. vitamin KHis converted to vitamin K epoxide as part of the γ-carboxylation reaction catalyzed by γ-glutamyl carboxylase.

It plays an important role in signal transduction pathways, where it acts as a second messenger, in neurotransmitter release from neurons, contraction of all muscle cell types, and fertilization. Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor, those of the blood-clotting cascade being notable examples. Extracellular calcium is also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation.",[Ca],"Calcium plays a vital role in the anatomy, physiology and biochemistry of organisms and of the cell, particularly in signal transduction pathways. More than  human proteins are known to bind or transport calcium. The skeleton acts as a major mineral storage site for the element and releases Ca+ ions into the bloodstream under controlled conditions. Circulating calcium is either in the free, ionized form or bound to blood proteins such as serum albumin. Parathyroid hormone (secreted from the parathyroid gland) regulates the resorption of Ca+ from bone. Calcitonin stimulates incorporation of calcium in bone, although this process is largely independent of calcitonin. Although calcium flow to and from the bone is neutral, about  mmol is turned over a day. Bone serves as an important storage point for calcium, as it contains % of the total body calcium. Low calcium intake may also be a risk factor in the development of osteoporosis. The best-absorbed form of calcium from a pill is a calcium salt like carbonate or phosphate. Calcium gluconate and calcium lactate are absorbed well by pregnant women. Seniors absorb calcium lactate, gluconate and citrate better unless they take their calcium supplement with a full breakfast. The currently recommended calcium intake is , milligrams per day for women not taking estrogen and  milligrams per day for women on estrogen. There is close to  milligrams of calcium in one cup of fluid milk. Calcium carbonate is currently the best and least expensive form of calcium supplement available.TargetActionsOrganismAVoltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit alpha-CligandHumansACalcium-transporting ATPase type C member agonistHumansATroponin C, skeletal muscleagonistHumansATroponin C, slow skeletal and cardiac musclesagonistHumansUSpectrin beta chain, non-erythrocytic agonistHumansUProtein S-BNot AvailableHumansUCalpastatinNot AvailableHumansUCartilage oligomeric matrix proteinNot AvailableHumansUCalmodulinNot AvailableHumansUAmiloride-sensitive amine oxidase [copper-containing]Not AvailableHumansUProtein S-ANot AvailableHumansUAlkaline phosphatase, placental typeNot AvailableHumansUProtein S-ANot AvailableHumansUProtein S-ANot AvailableHumansUProtein S-ANot AvailableHumansUCeruloplasminNot AvailableHumansUBone morphogenetic protein Not AvailableHumansUMatrix Gla proteinNot AvailableHumansUProtocadherin-Not AvailableHumansUProgrammed cell death protein Not AvailableHumans","['Care of the Joint', 'Mineral supplementation therapy', 'Nutritional supplementation']","['Alimentary Tract and Metabolism', 'Antacids and Adsorbents', 'Biological Factors', 'Blood Coagulation Factors', 'Calcium Salts', 'Calcium-Regulating Hormones and Agents', 'Drugs Affecting Bone Structure and Mineralization', 'Drugs for Treatment of Bone Diseases', 'Elements', 'Metals', 'Metals, Alkaline Earth', 'Minerals', 'Musculo-Skeletal System', 'Phosphate Binder', 'Phosphate Chelating Activity', 'Replacement Preparations']"

Five dopamine receptor types from two dopaminergic subfamilies have been identified. The dopaminergic D1 receptor subfamily consists of D1and D5subreceptors, which are associated with dyskinesias. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D2, D3and D4subreceptors, which are associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D2and D3receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. It is thought that postsynaptic D2stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists, while presynaptic D2stimulation confers neuroprotective effects. This semisynthetic ergot derivative exhibits potent agonist activity on dopamine D2-receptors. It also exhibits agonist activity (in order of decreasing binding affinity) on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1D, dopamine D3, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2Creceptors, antagonist activity on α2A-adrenergic, α2C, α2B, and dopamine D1receptors, partial agonist activity at receptor 5-HT2B, and inactivates dopamine D4and 5-HT7receptors. Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity (e.g. movement, balance, walking), loss of activity may result in dystonia (acute muscle contraction), Parkinsonism (including symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and flattened affect), akathesia (inner restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long-term loss of dopaminergic activity), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT2Aagonism. The tuberoinfundibular pathway of the brain originates in the hypothalamus and terminates in the pituitary gland. In this pathway, dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin. Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion making bromocriptine an effective agent for treating disorders associated with hypersecretion of prolactin.

Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p/p MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase.

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the influx of calcium ions into both vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental studies imply that amlodipine binds to bothdihydropyridineandnondihydropyridinebinding sites, located on cell membranes. The contraction of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent on the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells by specific ion channels. Amlodipine blocks calcium ion influx across cell membranes with selectivity. A stronger effect of amlodipine is exerted on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cellsLabel. Direct actions of amlodipine on vascular smooth muscle result in reduced blood pressure.Mechanism of action in anginaThe exact mechanism by which amlodipine relieves the symptoms of angina have not been fully elucidated to this date, however, the mechanism of action is likely twofold:Amlodipine has a dilating effect on peripheral arterioles, reducing the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the cardiac muscle functions. Since the heart rate remains stable during amlodipine administration, the reduced work of the heart reduces both myocardial energy use and oxygen requirements.Dilatation of the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in healthy and ischemic areas, is another possible mechanism of amlodipine reduction of blood pressure. The dilatation causes an increase in myocardial oxygen delivery in patients experiencing coronary artery spasm (Prinzmetal's or variant angina) and reduces coronary vasoconstriction caused by smoking.TargetActionsOrganismAVoltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit alpha-CinhibitorHumansAVoltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-IinhibitorHumansUVoltage-dependent N-type calcium channel subunit alpha-BinhibitorHumansUVoltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit beta-inhibitorHumansUVoltage-dependent calcium channel subunit alpha-/delta-inhibitorHumansUCarbonic anhydrase inhibitorHumansUSphingomyelin phosphodiesteraseinhibitorHumansUVoltage-dependent N-type calcium channelinhibitorHumans",[],"['ACE Inhibitors and Calcium Channel Blockers', 'Agents causing hyperkalemia', 'Angiotensin II Antagonists and Calcium Channel Blockers', 'Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium channel blockers', 'Antianginal Agents', 'Antiarrhythmic agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents Indicated for Hypertension', 'Bradycardia-Causing Agents', 'Calcium Channel Blockers', 'Calcium Channel Blockers (Dihydropyridine)', 'Calcium Channel Blockers and Diuretics', 'Calcium-Regulating Hormones and Agents', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Dihydropyridine Derivatives', 'Dihydropyridines', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'Membrane Transport Modulators', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'P-glycoprotein substrates', 'Pyridines', 'Selective Calcium Channel Blockers With Mainly Vascular Effects', 'Vasodilating Agents']"

Clinical evidence has associated potassium intake with lower blood pressure in adults, reducing the risk stroke and heart disease. Dietary potassium may exert beneficial effects on bone loss in the elderly and kidney stones. Consumption of white vegetables, which are normally high in potassium, is associated with a lower risk of stroke.9A note on gastrointestinal lesionsPotassium in solid oral preparations (for example, tablets) can cause ulcerative or stenotic lesions in the esophagus and stomach. Use diluted liquid potassium preparations or injection preparations if there are concerns about gastrointestinal health.13",[KH],"Potassium ion is the primary intracellular cation found in virtually all body tissues.The total amount of body potassium in adults is estimated at  millimole (mmol)/kg body weight (about  g for an adult weighing  pounds;  mmol =  milliequivalent or . mg of potassium). Potassium mainly stays in cells, and a small amount can be found in the extracellular fluid. The amount of potassium that stays in the cell (intracellular) is  times that of extracellular concentration, creating a transmembrane gradient, regulated by the sodium-potassium (Na+/K+) ATPase transporter. This is an important gradient for nerve conduction, muscle contractions, and renal function.Vomiting, diarrhea, renal disease, medications, and other conditions that alter potassium excretion or shift it inside or outside of cells. In healthy patients individuals with normal renal function, markedly high or low potassium levels are rare.Effect on blood pressurePotassium decreases reduces intravascular volume, by reducing sodium reabsorption through an increase in urinary sodium excretion. This short-term effect, however, does not explain the long-term effects of potassium on blood pressure. Increased plasma potassium levels that occur through intake are associated with vasodilation occurring via stimulation of the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase pump (Na+/-K+ATPase) and opening of potassium channels of the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase pump. Other possible mechanisms of action for potassium may include alterations in barroreflex sensitivity and hormone sensitivity in vascular smooth muscle and cells of the sympathetic nervous system.Effect on electrolyte balance and body systemsThe potassium gradient across the membrane of a cell regulates cell membrane potential, maintained predominantly by the sodium-potassium (Na+/-K+ ATPase pump). Transmembrane electro-chemical gradients encourage diffusion of Na+ extracellularly and K+ intracellularly. Potassium supplementation prevents hypokalemia to maintain this balance and is often used in an oral solution or injection form in the clinical setting, preventing harmful effects such as arrhythmias, abnormal muscle function, and neurological disturbances.When activated, the Na+/-K+ ATPase pump exchanges two extracellular K+ ions for three intracellular sodium (Na+) ions, impacting membrane potential via either excitation or inhibition. This is especially important in the homeostasis of the nervous system, kidney, and cardiac muscle tissue. The body and cell distributions of potassium in normal conditions are known as internal and external balance, respectively.Reduced serum potassium (or imbalance) increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia, heart failure and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).TargetActionsOrganismUSodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit alpha-regulatorHumans",[],"['Agents causing hyperkalemia', 'Diuretics', 'Elements', 'High-Ceiling Diuretics', 'Low-Ceiling Diuretics, Excl.

This inhibition results in increased excretion of water along with sodium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, hydrogen, and potassium ions.As with other loop diuretics, furosemide decreases the excretion of uric acid.Furosemide exerts direct vasodilatory effects, which results in its therapeutic effectiveness in the treatment of acute pulmonary edema. Vasodilation leads to reduced responsiveness to vasoconstrictors, such as angiotensin II and noradrenaline, and decreased production of endogenous natriuretic hormones with vasoconstricting properties.

Blocking of adenosine receptors promotes catecholamine release, leading to stimulatory effects occurring in the heart and the rest of the body. In the blood vessels, caffeine exerts direct antagonism of adenosine receptors, causing vasodilation. It stimulates the endothelial cells in the blood vessel wall to release nitric oxide, potentiating blood vessel relaxation. Catecholamine release, however, antagonizes this and exerts inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart, ultimately leading to vasoconstriction. Finally, caffeine is shown to raise systolic blood pressure measurements by  to  mmHg when it is not taken regularly, versus no effect in those who consume it regularly.The vasoconstricting effects of caffeine are beneficial in migraines and other types of headache, which are normally caused by vasodilation in the brain.,TargetActionsOrganismAAdenosine receptor AantagonistHumansAAdenosine receptor AaantagonistHumansAAdenosine receptor AbantagonistHumansAAdenosine receptor AantagonistHumansAPhosphodiesterase enzymesinhibitorHumansUcAMP-specific ','-cyclic phosphodiesterase BinhibitorHumansURyanodine receptor Not AvailableHumansUCyclic nucleotide phosphodiesteraseinhibitorHumansUDNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunitinhibitorHumansUPhosphatidylinositol ,-bisphosphate -kinase catalytic subunit delta isoforminhibitorHumansUPhosphatidylinositol ,-bisphosphate -kinase catalytic subunit alpha isoforminhibitorHumansUPhosphatidylinositol ,-bisphosphate -kinase catalytic subunit beta isoforminhibitorHumansUInositol ,,-trisphosphate receptorinhibitorHumansUSerine-protein kinase ATMinhibitorHumans","['Analgesia', 'Antacid therapy', 'Athletic Performance']","['Alkaloids', 'Anorexigenic Agents & Respiratory and CNS Stimulants', 'BCRP/ABCG2 Inhibitors', 'Caffeine and Caffeine Containing Products', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Stimulants', 'Central Nervous System Stimulation', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Dermatologicals', 'Diagnostic Agents', 'Drugs for Obstructive Airway Diseases', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors', 'Psychoanaleptics', 'Psychostimulants, Agents Used for ADHD and Nootropics', 'Purinergic Agents', 'Purinergic Antagonists', 'Purines', 'Purinones', 'Respiratory and CNS Stimulants', 'Tests for Gastric Secretion', 'Tricarboxylic Acids', 'Xanthine derivatives']"

When used topically, tretinoin regulates epidermal cell turnover and collagen production. It also prevents collagen loss, reduces inflammation, and blocks the induction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), which are enzymes that disrupt collagen and elastic fibres.1,2,3,10In short-term and long-term studies, topical application of tretinoin at doses ranging from 0.001% to 0.1% was associated with improvements in clinical signs of photoaging and fine wrinkles, increased epidermal thickness, compaction of the stratum corneum, and decreased melanin content.4,10,11,7It also improved melanocyte differentiation and distribution, promotion of epidermal hyperplasia, and angiogenesis.7Tretinoin exhibits antineoplastic activities when given orally.13Tretinoin was shown to induce differentiation in tumour cells.6It induced cytodifferentiation and decreased acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell proliferation in culture andin vivo. In patients with APL, tretinoin promoted the initial maturation of the primitive promyelocytes derived from the leukemic clone, followed by a repopulation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by normal, polyclonal hematopoietic cells in patients achieving complete remission.13",C\C(\C=C\C1=C(C)CCCC1(C)C)=C/C=C/C(/C)=C/C(O)=O,"The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin in skin conditions and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has not been fully elucidated; however, several proposed mechanisms exist. Tretinoin is believed to exert its pharmacological actions by binding to and activating two types of nuclear receptors - retinoic acid receptors (RARs) alpha, beta, and gamma and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). In the human skin, RARs (especially RAR-alpha) form heterodimers with RXR to act as inducible transcription regulators of genes involved in cell differentiation by binding to retinoic acid response elements.,Tretinoin binds to RXRs to promote epidermal proliferation. It also blocks the actions of inflammatory mediators, enhancing procollagen production and collagen type I and III formations.,,,Some animal and human studies suggest that tretinoin induces the expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), which stimulates the transcription of several types of collagen messenger RNA. Collagen formation curtails further solar UV-induced skin damage and aging processes.Acne is associated with abnormal follicular formation from excessive keratinization of epithelial cells. Tretinoin promotes cornified cell detachment and enhances keratinocyte shedding. It also stimulates mitotic activity and loosely-adherent corneocyte turnover to expel comedo contents, reducing microcomedo precursor lesions of acne vulgaris.,Tretinoin may reduce epidermal melanin and pigmentation by increasing keratinocyte turnover and reducing tyrosinase activity.,RAR-alpha and -beta have also been implicated in APL.APL is characterized by a t(;) chromosomal translocation, which fuses the promyelocytic myeloid leukemia (PML) gene with the RAR-alpha gene.,The resulting PML-RAR-alpha fusion protein plays a role in the pathogenesis of APL by aberrating promyelocyte differentiation. The PML-RAR-alpha fusion protein is found to be predominant in leukemic cells, exerting a dominant negative effect on RAR, RXR and PML function.Tretinoin induces terminal differentiation in hemopoietic precursor cell lines and APL cells.Tretinoin is believed to promote caspase-mediated cleavage and proteasome-dependent degradation to cause apoptosis and degradation of the PML-RAR-alpha fusion protein.It may also convert the fusion protein from a transcription repressor to an activator.TargetActionsOrganismARetinoic acid receptor alphaagonistHumansARetinoic acid receptor betaagonistHumansARetinoic acid receptor gammaagonistHumansURetinoic acid receptor RXR-alphaagonistHumansARetinoic acid receptor RXR-betaagonistHumansARetinoic acid receptor RXR-gammaagonistHumansUCellular retinoic acid-binding protein binderHumansURetinoic acid receptor responder protein agonistHumansURetinal dehydrogenase substrateHumansURetinal dehydrogenase substrateHumansURetinoic acid-induced protein regulatorHumansULipocalin-binderHumansUOdorant-binding protein abinderHumansURetinol-binding protein binderHumansU[Pyruvate dehydrogenase [lipoamide]] kinase isozyme , mitochondrialupregulatorHumansUCarcinoembryonic antigendownregulatorHumans",[],"['Agents that produce hypertension', 'Alkenes', 'Anti-Acne Preparations', 'Anti-Acne Preparations for Topical Use', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents', 'Biological Factors', 'Cardiotoxic antineoplastic agents', 'Carotenoids', 'Cell Stimulants and Proliferants', 'Cyclohexanes', 'Cyclohexenes', 'Cycloparaffins', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C18 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Dermatologicals', 'Diterpenes', 'Hydrocarbons, Acyclic', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Keratolytic Agents', 'Pigments, Biological', 'Polyenes', 'Retinoids', 'Retinoids for cancer treatment', 'Retinoids for Topical Use in Acne', 'Terpenes', 'UGT2B7 substrates', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamins', 'Vitamins (Fat Soluble)']"

NPCL is expressed on enterocytes/gut lumen (apical) as well as the hepatobiliary (canalicular) interface and plays a role in facilitating internalization of free cholesterol into the enterocyte in conjunction with the adaptor protein  (AP) complex and clathrin.Once cholesterol in the gut lumen or bile is incorporated into the cell membrane of enterocytes, it binds to the sterol-sensing domain of NPCL and forms a NPCL/cholesterol complex. The complex is then internalized or endocytosed by joining to AP clathrin, forming a vesicle complex that is translocated for storage in the endocytic recycling compartment.Ezetimibe does not require exocrine pancreatic function for its pharmacological activity; rather, it localizes and appears to act at the brush border of the small intestine. Ezetimibe selectively blocks the NPCL protein in the jejunal brush border, reducing the uptake of intestinal lumen micelles into the enterocyte.Overall, ezetimibe causes a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver and reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood. While the full mechanism of action of ezetimibe in reducing the entry of cholesterol into both enterocytes and hepatocytes is not fully understood, one study proposed that ezetimibe prevents the NPCL/sterol complex from interacting with AP in clathrin coated vesicles and induces a conformational change in NPCL, rendering it incapable of binding to sterols.Another study suggested that ezetimibe disrupts the function of other protein complexes involved in regulating cholesterol uptake, including the CAV–annexin  heterocomplex.TargetActionsOrganismANiemann-Pick C-like protein inhibitorHumansASterol O-acyltransferase inhibitorHumansUAminopeptidase NotherHumans",[],"['Anticholesteremic Agents', 'Azetines', 'BCRP/ABCG2 Substrates', 'BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Decreased Cholesterol Absorption', 'Dietary Cholesterol Absorption Inhibitor', 'Hypolipidemic Agents', 'Hypolipidemic Agents Indicated for Hyperlipidemia', 'Lipid Modifying Agents', 'Lipid Modifying Agents, Plain', 'Lipid Regulating Agents', 'Non-statin Hypolipidemic Agents Indicated for Hyperlipidemia', 'OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Substrates', 'P-glycoprotein substrates', 'UGT1A1 Substrates', 'UGT1A3 substrates', 'UGT2B7 substrates']"

It is currently the only specific and effective treatment for malignant hyperthermia. In isolated nerve-muscle preparation, Dantrium has been shown to produce relaxation by affecting the contractile response of the muscle at a site beyond the myoneural junction. In skeletal muscle, Dantrium dissociates excitation-contraction coupling, probably by interfering with the release of Ca2+from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In the anesthetic-induced malignant hyperthermia syndrome, evidence points to an intrinsic abnormality of skeletal muscle tissue. In selected humans, it has been postulated that “triggering agents” (e.g.,general anesthetics and depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents) produce a change within the cell which results in an elevated myoplasmic calcium. This elevated myoplasmic calcium activates acute cellular catabolic processes that cascade to the malignant hyperthermia crisis.

Biotin not only assists in various metabolic chemical conversions, but also helps with the transfer of carbon dioxide. Biotin is also helpful in maintaining a steady blood sugar level. Biotin is often recommended for strengthening hair and nails. Consequenty, it is found in many cosmetic and health products for the hair and skin. Biotin deficiency is a rare nutritional disorder caused by a deficiency of biotin. Initial symptoms of biotin deficiency include: Dry skin, Seborrheic dermatitis, Fungal infections, rashes including erythematous periorofacial macular rash, fine and brittle hair, and hair loss or total alopecia. If left untreated, neurological symptoms can develop, including mild depression, which may progress to profound lassitude and, eventually, to somnolence; changes in mental status, generalized muscular pains (myalgias), hyperesthesias and paresthesias. The treatment for biotin deficiency is to simply start taking some biotin supplements. A lack of biotin in infants will lead to a condition called seborrheic dermatitis or ""cradle cap"".

It is found widely in nature and is involved in numerous enzymatic reactions in which it serves as an electron carrier by being alternately oxidized (NAD+) and reduced (NADH). The action of supplemental NADH is unclear. Oral NADH supplementation has been used to combat simple fatigue as well as such mysterious and energy-sapping disorders as chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. Researchers are also studying the value of NADH supplements for improving mental function in people with Alzheimer's disease, and minimizing physical disability and relieving depression in people with Parkinson's disease.

It does require the essential nutrient nicotinamide for its synthesis, and its role in energy production is certainly an essential one. In addition to its role in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, NADH is produced in the cytosol. The mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH, and this permeability barrier effectively separates the cytoplasmic from the mitochondrial NADH pools. However, cytoplasmic NADH can be used for biologic energy production. This occurs when the malate-aspartate shuttle introduces reducing equivalents from NADH in the cytosol to the electron transport chain of the mitochondria. This shuttle mainly occurs in the liver and heart.TargetActionsOrganismUUDP-glucose -dehydrogenaseNot AvailableHumansUAlcohol dehydrogenase ANot AvailableHumansUSorbitol dehydrogenaseNot

It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations30.Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions13:Colds:Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently13.Wound healing:Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements13.Diahrrea: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition13.",[Zn],"Zinc has three primary biological roles:catalytic,structural, andregulatory. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately  human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones.Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins.In HL- cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-beta, and IL-.There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine --cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to  September .Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serumthymulin(a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper  (Th()) cytokines are decreased but T-helper  (Th()) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans.The change ofTh()toTh()function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL- production (Th() cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells.In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-, a Th() human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th() cytokine production.In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers. In HL- cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-beta, and IL- cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers.The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels.TargetActionsOrganismUB bradykinin receptorNot AvailableHumansUMethylated-DNA--protein-cysteine methyltransferaseNot AvailableHumansUFructose-bisphosphate aldolase

As a synthetic progestin, norethisterone acts similarly to endogenous progesterone but with a much higher potency - it acts at the pelvic level to alter cervical and endometrial function, as well as via the inhibition of pituitary hormones that play a role in follicular maturation and ovulation.14A small increase in the risk of developing breast cancer has been observed in patients using combined oral contraceptives, with some evidence also implicating progestin-only pills - patients starting hormonal contraception should be advised of this risk and should employ routine breast self-examinations to check for evidence of any developing masses.14",[H][C@@]12CC[C@@](O)(C#C)[C@@]1(C)CC[C@]1([H])[C@@]3([H])CCC(=O)C=C3CC[C@@]21[H],"On a molecular level, progestins like norethisterone exert their effects on target cells via binding to progesterone receptors that result in downstream changes to target genes.Target cells are found in the reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, skeletal tissue, and central nervous system.Contraceptive efficacy is derived mainly from changes to the cervical mucus, wherein norethisterone increases the cell content and viscosity of the mucous to impede sperm transport and migration.Norethisterone also induces a variety of changes to the endometrium - including atrophy, irregular secretion, and suppressed proliferation - that make it inhospitable for implantation.,Working via a negative feedback loop, norethisterone also acts on both the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to suppress the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary. Suppression of these hormones prevents follicular development, ovulation, and corpus luteum development.When used as a component of hormone replacement therapy in menopausal women, norethisterone’s value is mainly in suppressing the growth of the endometrium.As estrogen stimulates endometrial growth, the unopposed use of estrogen in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus can lead to endometrial hyperplasia which can increase the risk of endometrial cancer. The addition of a progestin to a hormone replacement therapy in this population protects against this endometrial hyperplasia and, therefore, lowers the risk associated with the use of hormone replacement therapies.Norethisterone, along with other progestins and endogenous progesterone, has a low affinity for other steroid receptors, such as the androgen receptor and glucocorticoid receptor.,While affinity and agonistic activity at these receptors is minimal, it is thought that androgen receptor agonism is responsible for some of the adverse effects observed with progestin use (e.g. acne, serum lipid changes).TargetActionsOrganismAProgesterone receptoragonistHumansUAndrogen receptoragonistHumansUGlucocorticoid receptoragonistHumans","['Contraception', 'Hormone Replacement Therapy', 'Oral Contraceptives']","['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Anti-Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormones', 'Combination Contraceptives (with Estrogen and derivatives)', 'Contraceptive Agents, Female', 'Contraceptive Agents, Hormonal', 'Contraceptives, Oral', 'Contraceptives, Oral, Hormonal', 'Contraceptives, Oral, Synthetic', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Estren Derivatives', 'Fused-Ring Compounds', 'Genito Urinary System and Sex Hormones', 'Hormonal Contraceptives for Systemic Use', 'Hyperglycemia-Associated Agents', 'Hypothalamic Hormones', 'Norpregnenes', 'Norsteroids', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'Pituitary and Hypothalamic Hormones and Analogues', 'Progestin Contraceptives', 'Progestins', 'Progestogens and Estrogens, Sequential Preparations', 'Reproductive Control Agents', 'Sex Hormones and Modulators of the Genital System', 'Steroids', 'Systemic Hormonal Preparations, Excl.

Other cytopenias may also occur during methimazole therapy.

These thyroglobulin molecules then degrade within thyroid follicular cells to form either thyroxine (T) or tri-iodothyronine (T), which are the main hormones produced by the thyroid gland.Methimazole may directly inhibit TPO, but has been shown in vivo to instead act as a competitive substrate for TPO, thus becoming iodinated itself and interfering with the iodination of thyroglobulin.Another proposed theory is that methimazole’s sulfur moiety may interact directly with the iron atom at the centre of TPO’s heme molecule, thus inhibiting its ability to iodinate tyrosine residues.Other proposed mechanisms with weaker evidence include methimazole binding directly to thyroglobulin or direct inhibition of thyroglobulin itself.TargetActionsOrganismAThyroid peroxidasesubstrateinhibitorHumans",[],"['Antithyroid agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inhibitors (strong)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strong)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Hormone Antagonists', 'Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists', 'Imidazoles', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Myelosuppressive Agents', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'Sulfur-Containing Imidazole Derivatives', 'Systemic Hormonal Preparations, Excl.

Inflammation is a primary defense mechanism and the homeostatic response of the immune system; however, a prolonged inflammatory response in certain disorders may lead to tissue damage, pain, and swelling. Beclomethasone dipropionate works by attenuating the inflammatory responses associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, and corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. It suppresses the actions of inflammatory cells, such as mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. It also inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines.11Beclomethasone dipropionate is reported to exhibit potent topical activity while possessing low systemic effects.2Beclomethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid drug with anti-inflammatory and vasoconstrictive effects used to treat chronic inflammatory processes such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. When inhaled, it improves lung function, decreases airway hyper-reactivity, and reduces the severity of asthmatic symptoms.9Although inhaled corticosteroids, including beclomethasone dipropionate, are reported to mainly act locally in the lungs, systemic effects such as disruption of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, bone turnover, osteoporosis, and growth suppression may still be observed with chronic use or high dose administration. There were varying findings from clinical studies examining the effect of beclomethasone dipropionate on growth suppression in pediatric patients.9It was shown to suppress the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in a dose-dependent manner.6HPA axis is a central hormonal response system to stress and activation of HPA axis leads to the production of endogenous steroid hormone production.7Long-term use of high-dose systemic corticosteroids, including those inhaled, was often associated with signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to stress conditions, such as trauma, surgery, or infections. As corticosteroids work by suppressing the immune system, there may be an increased risk for developing infections.11Cases ofCandida albicansinfection of the mouth and throat have been reported with inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate therapy.8",[H][C@@]12C[C@H](C)[C@](OC(=O)CC)(C(=O)COC(=O)CC)[C@@]1(C)C[C@H](O)[C@@]1(Cl)[C@@]2([H])CCC2=CC(=O)C=C[C@]12C,"Beclomethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid and prodrug that is rapidly activated by hydrolysis to the active monoester,  monopropionate (-BMP), which mediates anti-inflammatory actions. -BMP has been shownin vitroto exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor which is approximately  times that of dexamethasone and  times that of beclomethasone dipropionate.Upon binding of the ligand, the glucocorticoid receptors dimerize and translocate into the nucleus, where they subsequently bind to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) on glucocorticoid-responsive genes, leading to changes in transcription. There are several proposed mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids may work by increasing the transcription of genes coding for anti-inflammatory proteins, including lipocortin- and interleukin-.Corticosteroids were also shown to inhibit the expression of multiple genes that encode pro-inflammatory factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, that are activated during the chronic inflammatory process.This is thought to be due to the direct inhibitory interaction between activated glucocorticoid receptors and activated pro-inflammatory transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-.Chronic inflammation is often characterized by enhanced expression of these transcription factors that bind to and activate coactivator molecules, which then acetylate core histones to switch on gene transcription to further amplify the inflammatory process.Corticosteroids suppress the multiple inflammatory gene expression by promoting histone deacetylation, resulting in tighter coiling of DNA and reduced access of transcription factors to their binding sites.TargetActionsOrganismAGlucocorticoid receptoragonistHumans",[],"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adrenals', 'Agents to Treat Airway Disease', 'Alimentary Tract and Metabolism', 'Anti-Asthmatic Agents', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antidiarrheals, Intestinal Antiinflammatory/antiinfective Agents', 'BCRP/ABCG2 Inhibitors', 'Corticosteroid Hormone Receptor Agonists', 'Corticosteroids', 'Corticosteroids Acting Locally', 'Corticosteroids, Dermatological Preparations', 'Corticosteroids, Potent (Group III)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Dermatologicals', 'Drugs for Obstructive Airway Diseases', 'Fused-Ring Compounds', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Hormones', 'Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists', 'Hyperglycemia-Associated Agents', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Intestinal Antiinflammatory Agents', 'Nasal Preparations', 'OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors', 'OATP1B3 inhibitors', 'P-glycoprotein inducers', 'P-glycoprotein substrates', 'Pregnadienes', 'Pregnadienetriols', 'Pregnanes', 'Respiratory System Agents', 'Steroids', 'Steroids, Chlorinated', 'Thyroxine-binding globulin inhibitors']"

It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations29.Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions12:Colds:Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently12.Wound healing:Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements12.Diahrrea: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition12.",[Zn++].CC([O-])=O.CC([O-])=O,"Zinc has three primary biological roles:catalytic,structural, andregulatory. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately  human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones.Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins.In HL- cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-beta, and IL-.There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine --cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to  September .Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serumthymulin(a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper  (Th()) cytokines are decreased but T-helper  (Th()) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans.The change ofTh()toTh()function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL- production (Th() cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells.In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-, a Th() human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th() cytokine production.In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers. In HL- cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-beta, and IL- cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers.The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels.TargetActionsOrganismUB bradykinin receptorNot AvailableHumansUMethylated-DNA--protein-cysteine methyltransferaseNot AvailableHumansUFructose-bisphosphate aldolase

Aminoglycosides are useful primarily in infections involving aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter. In addition, some mycobacteria, including the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, are susceptible to aminoglycosides. Infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria can also be treated with aminoglycosides, but other types of antibiotics are more potent and less damaging to the host.

TRPV1 is a trans-membrane receptor-ion channel complex activated by temperatures higher than 43 degrees Celsius, pH lower than 6, and endogenous lipids. When activated by a combination of these factors, the channel can transiently open and initiate depolarization due to the influx of calcium and sodium ions. Because TRPV1 is commonly expressed in A-delta and mostly C fibers, depolarization results in action potentials which send impulses to the brain and spinal cord. These impulses result in capsaicin effects of warming, tingling, itching, stinging, or burning. Capsaicin also causes more persistent activation of these receptors compared to the environmental agonists, resulting in a loss of response to many sensory stimuli, described as ""defunctionalization"".

Grave's disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is an autoimmune disease where an individual's own antibodies attach to thyroid stimulating hormone receptors within cells of the thyroid gland and then trigger overproduction of thyroid hormone. The two thyroid hormones manufactured by the thyroid gland, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), are formed by combining iodine and a protein called thyroglobulin with the assistance of an enzyme called peroxidase. PTU inhibits iodine and peroxidase from their normal interactions with thyroglobulin to form T4 and T3. This action decreases thyroid hormone production. PTU also interferes with the conversion of T4 to T3, and, since T3 is more potent than T4, this also reduces the activity of thyroid hormones.

Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such asMethotrexateas they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.In general, folate serum levels below 5 ng/mL indicate folate deficiency, and levels below 2 ng/mL usually result in megaloblastic anemia.",NC1=NC(=O)C2=NC(CNC3=CC=C(C=C3)C(=O)N[C@@H](CCC(O)=O)C(O)=O)=CN=C2N1,"Folic acid, as it is biochemically inactive, is converted to tetrahydrofolic acid and methyltetrahydrofolate by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).

It is a member of the nucleoside antimetabolite drugs that interfere with duplication of the viral genetic material. The drug inhibits the activity of the enzyme RNA dependent RNA polymerase, due to its resemblence to building blocks of the RNA molecules.",NC(=O)C1=NN(C=N1)[C@@H]1O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O,"Ribavirin is reported to have several mechanism of actions that lead to inhibition of viral RNA and protein synthesis.
After activation by adenosine kinase to ribavirin mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. Ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is the predominant metabolite which directly inhibits viral mRNA polymerase by binding to the nucleotide binding site of the enzyme. This prevents the binding of the correct nucleotides, leading to a reduction in viral replication or to the production of defective virions. RTP also demonstrates an inhibitory action on viral mRNA guanylyltransferase and mRNA ′-O-methyltransferase of dengue virus. Inhibition of these enzymes disrupts the posttranslational capping of the ′ end of viral mRNA through ribavirin being incorporated at the ′ end in place of guanosine and preventing the cap methylation step.Inhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and subsequent depletion of GTP pool is proposed to be another mechanism of action of ribavirin. IMPDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step where inosine ′-monophosphate is converted to xanthine monophosphate during guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis. GMP is later converted to guanosine triphoshpate (GTP). Ribavirin monophosphate mimics inosine ′-monophosphate and acts as a competitive inhibitor of IMPDH. Inhibited de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides and decreased intracellular GTP pools leads to a decline in viral protein synthesis and limit replication of viral genomes.Ribavirin acts as a mutagen in the target virus to cause an 'error catastrophe' due to increased viral mutations. RTP pairs with cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate with equal efficiency and to block HCV RNA elongation. It causes premature termination of nascent HCV RNA and increases mutagenesis by producing defective virions.Ribavirin also exerts an immunomodulatory action of the host to the virus by shifting a Th response in favor of a Th phenotype. Th response and production of type  cytokines such as IL-, IL-, and IL- stimulates the humoral response which enhances immunity toward the virus. Ribavirin enhanced induction of interferon-related genes, including the interferon-α receptor, and down-regulation of genes involved in interferon inhibition, apoptosis, and hepatic stellate cell activation in vitro.TargetActionsOrganismAInosine-'-monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitorHumansARNA-directed RNA polymerase LantagonistHPIV-AGenome polyproteininhibitorDENV-UInosine-'-monophosphate dehydrogenase Not AvailableHumansURNA-directed RNA polymerase catalytic subunitinhibitorInfluenza A virus (strain A/Beijing// HN)",[],"['Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antiinfectives for Systemic Use', 'Antimetabolites', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antivirals for Systemic Use', 'Antivirals for treatment of HCV infections', 'Direct Acting Antivirals', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Noxae', 'Nucleic Acids, Nucleotides, and Nucleosides', 'Nucleoside Analog Antiviral', 'Nucleosides', 'Nucleosides and Nucleotides', 'Ribonucleosides', 'Toxic Actions', 'Treatments for Hepatitis C']"

In both cats and rats, carbamazepine was shown to decrease pain caused by infraorbital nerve stimulation. A decrease in the action potential in the nucleus ventralis of the thalamus in the brain and inhibition of the lingual mandibular reflex were observed in other studies after carbamazepine use. Carbamazepine causes the above effects by binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels and preventing action potentials, which normally lead to stimulatory effects on nerves.,In bipolar disorder, carbamazepine is thought to increase dopamine turnover and increase GABA transmission, treating manic and depressive symptoms.A common issue that has arisen is resistance to this drug in up to % of epileptic patients, which may occur to altered metabolism in patients with variant genotypes.A potential therapeutic target to combat carbamazepine resistance has recently been identified as the EPHX gene promoter, potentially conferring resistance to carbamazepine through methylation.TargetActionsOrganismAVoltage-gated sodium channel alpha subunitinhibitorHumansUNeuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-Not AvailableHumansUNuclear receptor subfamily  group I member activatorHumans",[],"['Analgesics', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Antimanic Agents', 'Carboxamide Derivatives', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inducers (strong)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inducers (strong)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inducers (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers (strong)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (strong)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inducers (strong)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Decreased Central Nervous System Disorganized Electrical Activity', 'Dibenzazepines', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Enzyme Inducing Antiepileptic Drugs', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Inducers of Drug Clearance', 'Membrane Transport Modulators', 'Miscellaneous Anticonvulsants', 'Mood Stabilizer', 'Myelosuppressive Agents', 'Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs', 'P-glycoprotein inducers', 'P-glycoprotein substrates', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Sensory System Agents', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Sodium Channel Blockers', 'Thyroxine-binding globulin substrates', 'UGT1A1 Inducers', 'UGT1A6 inducer', 'UGT2B7 substrates', 'UGT2B7 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index']"

Both estrone and its sulphate conjugated form, estrone sulphate, represent the most abundant estrogens found in postmenopausal women.Estradiol, however, is considerably more potent than estrone and estriol at the estrogen receptor (ER). As a result, the higher estrone concentration in postmenopausal population, can cause various undesirable effects. These effects may include hot flashes, chills, vaginal dryness, mood swings, irregular menstruation, and chills, in addition to sleep problems.Estradiol workings by binding to subtypes of the estrogen receptor: estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ).

As with all antibiotics, ceftazidime may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms and potentially serious effects includingClostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD); CDAD should be considered in patients who develop diarrhea and, in confirmed cases, supportive care initiated immediately. Ceftazidime is primarily renally excreted such that high and prolonged serum concentrations can occur in patients with renal insufficiency, leading to seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia. Treatment may lead to the development or induction of resistance with a risk of treatment failure. Periodic susceptibility testing should be considered, and monotherapy failure may necessitate the addition of another antibiotic such as an aminoglycoside.

Compared to classical tricyclic antidepressants, Bupropion is a relatively weak inhibitor of the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine. In addition, Bupropion does not inhibit monoamine oxidase. Bupropion has been found to be essentially inactive at the serotonin transporter (SERT)(IC50 >10 000 nM),12however both bupropion and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion have been found to block the function of cation-selective serotonin type 3A receptors (5-HT3ARs).Bupropion produces dose-related central nervous system (CNS) stimulant effects in animals, as evidenced by increased locomotor activity, increased rates of responding in various schedule-controlled operant behaviour tasks, and, at high doses, induction of mild stereotyped behaviourLabel. Due to these stimulant effects and selective activity at dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, bupropion has been identified as having an abuse potential.Label,17Bupropion has a similar structure to the controlled substanceCathinone, and has been identified as having mild amphetamine-like activity, particularly when inhaled or injected.17Bupropion is also known to lower the seizure threshold, making any pre-existing seizure conditions a contraindication to its use. This risk is exacerbated when bupropion is combined with other drugs or substances that lower the seizure threshold, such ascocaine, or in clinical situations that would increase the risk of a seizure such as abrupt alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.LabelAs norepinephrine has been shown to have anticonvulsant properties, bupropion's inhibitory effects on NET are thought to contribute to its pro-convulsant activity.17Bupropion has been shown to increase blood pressure and pose a risk for exacerbation of unmanaged or pre-existing hypertension,18,Labelhowever, clinical trials of bupropion in smokers with CVD have not identified an increased incidence of CV events including stroke or heart attack.19In clinical trials, the mean increase in systolic blood pressure associated with the use of bupropion was found to be 1.3 mmHg.Label",CC(NC(C)(C)C)C(=O)C1=CC(Cl)=CC=C1,"Bupropion is a norepinephrine/dopamine-reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) that exerts its pharmacological effects by weakly inhibiting the enzymes involved in the uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their duration of action within the neuronal synapse and the downstream effects of these neurotransmitters. More specifically, bupropion binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT).,Bupropion was originally classified as an ""atypical"" antidepressant because it does not exert the same effects as the classical antidepressants such as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs), or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). While it has comparable effectiveness to typical first-line options for the treatment of depression such as SSRIs,,bupropion is a unique option for the treatment of MDD as it lacks any clinically relevant serotonergic effects, typical of other mood medications, or any effects on histamine or adrenaline receptors.,Lack of activity at these receptors results in a more tolerable side effect profile; bupropion is less likely to cause sexual side effects, sedation, or weight gain as compared to SSRIs or TCAs, for example.,When used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor (AChR), thereby blunting the effects of nicotine.,,Furthermore, the stimulatory effects produced by bupropion in the central nervous system are similar to nicotine's effects, making low doses of bupropion a suitable option as a nicotine substitute.When used in combination withnaltrexonein the marketed product ContraveⓇ for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake. This includes the hypothalamus, which is involved in appetite regulation, and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit, which is involved in reward pathways.Studies have shown that the combined activity of bupropion andnaltrexoneincrease the firing rate of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and blockade of opioid receptor-mediated POMC auto-inhibition, which are associated with a reduction in food intake and increased energy expenditure.,,This combination was also found to reduce food intake when injected directly into the ventral tegmental area of the mesolimbic circuit in mice, which is an area associated with the regulation of reward pathways.TargetActionsOrganismASodium-dependent dopamine transporterinhibitorHumansASodium-dependent noradrenaline transporterinhibitorHumansUNeuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-antagonistHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor Anegative modulatorHumans","['Smoking, Cessation', 'Weight Loss']","['Agents that reduce seizure threshold', 'Aminoketone Antidepressants', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antidepressive Agents Indicated for Depression', 'Antiobesity Preparations, Excl.

Prostaglandins are responsible for eliciting pain sensations.Acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, therefore, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory effects. Though acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the active site of this enzyme, studies have shown that acetaminophen (paracetamol) blocks COX indirectly.Studies also suggest that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant type of the COX enzyme that is unique from the known variants COX- and COX-.This enzyme has been referred to asCOX-. The antipyretic actions of acetaminophen are likely attributed to direct action on heat-regulating centers in the brain, resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating, and loss of body heat.The exact mechanism of action of this drug is not fully understood at this time, but future research may contribute to deeper knowledge.TargetActionsOrganismAProstaglandin G/H synthase inhibitorHumansAProstaglandin G/H synthase inhibitorHumansUProstaglandin E synthase inhibitorHumansUTransient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member activatorHumans","['Airway secretion clearance therapy', 'Anti-spasmodics', 'Bronchodilation']","['Acetaminophen and Prodrugs', 'Amides', 'Amines', 'Analgesics', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic', 'Anilides', 'Aniline Compounds', 'Antipyretics', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents', 'Miscellaneous Analgesics and Antipyretics', 'Nervous System', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'P-glycoprotein substrates', 'Sensory System Agents', 'UGT1A1 Substrates', 'UGT1A6 substrate', 'UGT1A9 Substrates']"

However, this class is limited by the development of movement disorders such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia, and other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. Compared to the lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such asChlorpromazine,Zuclopenthixol,Fluphenazine, andMethotrimeprazine, haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).6,7,8Low‐potency medications have a lower affinity for dopamine receptors so that a higher dose is required to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.The balance between the wanted drug effects on psychotic symptoms and unwanted side effects are largely at play within dopaminergic brain pathways affected by haloperidol. Cortical dopamine-D2-pathways play an important role in regulating these effects and include the nigrostriatal pathway, which is responsible for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, which are responsible for the improvement in positive schizophrenic symptoms, and the tuberoinfundibular dopamine pathway, which is responsible for hyperprolactinemia.A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome.16Cases of sudden death, QT-prolongation, and Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients receiving haloperidol. Higher than recommended doses of any formulation and intravenous administration of haloperidol appear to be associated with a higher risk of QT-prolongation and Torsades de Pointes. Although cases have been reported even in the absence of predisposing factors, particular caution is advised in treating patients with other QT-prolonging conditions (including electrolyte imbalance [particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia], drugs known to prolong QT, underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and familial long QT-syndrome).16A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.16",OC1(CCN(CCCC(=O)C2=CC=C(F)C=C2)CC1)C1=CC=C(Cl)C=C1,"While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain, it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Schizophrenia is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol, therefore, are thought to improve psychotic symptoms by halting this over-production of dopamine. The optimal clinical efficacy of antipsychotics is associated with the blockade of approximately  % -  % of D receptors in the brain.While the exact mechanism is not entirely understood, haloperidol is known to inhibit the effects of dopamine and increase its turnover. Traditional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, bind more tightly than dopamine itself to the dopamine D receptor, with dissociation constants that are lower than that for dopamine.It is believed that haloperidol competitively blocks post-synaptic dopamine (D) receptors in the brain, eliminating dopamine neurotransmission and leading to the relief of delusions and hallucinations that are commonly associated with psychosis. It acts primarily on the D-receptors and has some effect on -HT and α-receptors, with negligible effects on dopamine D-receptors. The drug also exerts some blockade of α-adrenergic receptors of the autonomic system.Antagonistic activity regulated through dopamine D receptors in the chemoreceptive trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain renders its antiemetic activity. Of the three D-like receptors, only the D receptor is blocked by antipsychotic drugs in direct relation to their clinical antipsychotic abilities.Clinical brain-imaging findings show that haloperidol remains tightly bound to D dopamine receptors in humans undergoing  positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a h pause in between scans.A common adverse effect of this drug is the development of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), due to this tight binding of haloperidol to the dopamine D receptor.Due to the risk of unpleasant and sometimes lifelong extrapyramidal symptoms, newer antipsychotic medications than haloperidol have been discovered and formulated. Rapid dissociation of drugs from dopamine D receptors is a plausible explanation for the improved EPS profile of atypical antipsychotics such asRisperidone. This is also consistent with the theory of a lower affinity for D receptors for these drugs. As mentioned above, haloperidol binds tightly to the dopamine receptor, potentiating the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms,and therefore should only been used when necessary.TargetActionsOrganismA-hydroxytryptamine receptor CNot AvailableHumansADopamine D receptorantagonistHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor Aother/unknownHumansUDopamine D receptorinverse agonistHumansUMelanin-concentrating hormone receptor Not AvailableHumansUSynaptic vesicular amine transporterNot AvailableHumansUSigma non-opioid intracellular receptor Not AvailableHumansUHistamine H receptorNot AvailableHumansUMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor MNot AvailableHumansUAlpha-A adrenergic receptorNot AvailableHumansUAlpha-A adrenergic receptorNot AvailableHumansUAlpha-B adrenergic receptorNot AvailableHumansUAlpha-C adrenergic receptorNot AvailableHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor ANot AvailableHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor Not AvailableHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor Not AvailableHumansUGlutamate receptor ionotropic, NMDA BantagonistHumansUDopamine D receptorantagonistHumans",[],"['Agents that reduce seizure threshold', 'Anti-Dyskinesia Agents', 'Antiemetics', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents (First Generation [Typical])', 'Autonomic Agents', 'Butyrophenone Derivatives', 'Butyrophenones', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Dopamine Antagonists', 'Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists', 'Drugs causing inadvertant photosensitivity', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Gastrointestinal Agents', 'Hyperglycemia-Associated Agents', 'Ketones', 'Moderate Risk QTc-Prolonging Agents', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotoxic agents', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'NMDA Receptor Antagonists', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'P-glycoprotein substrates', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Psycholeptics', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'QTc Prolonging Agents', 'Tranquilizing Agents', 'UGT1A9 Substrates']"

These are ionotropic receptors composed up of five homomeric or heteromeric subunits.

This causes the channel to open and allow conductance of multiple cations including sodium, calcium, and potassium. This leads to depolarization, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels and allows more calcium to enter the axon terminal. Calcium stimulates vesicle trafficking towards the plasma membrane and the release of dopamine into the synapse. Dopamine binding to its receptors is responsible the euphoric and addictive properties of nicotine.
Nicotine also binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. Binding opens the ion channel allowing influx of sodium, causing depolarization of the cell, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels.

The negative allosteric modulatory effects of CBD are therapeutically important as direct agonists are limited by their psychomimetic effects while direct antagonists are limited by their depressant effects.TargetActionsOrganismACannabinoid receptor antagonistmodulatorHumansUCannabinoid receptor antagonistHumansUG-protein coupled receptor inverse agonistHumansUGlycine receptor subunit alpha-Not AvailableHumansUGlycine receptor (alpha-/beta)allosteric modulatorHumansUGlycine receptor subunit alpha-potentiatorHumansUN-arachidonyl glycine receptorNot AvailableHumansUG-protein coupled receptor antagonistHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor AagonistHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor AagonistHumansUNeuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-Not AvailableHumansUDelta-type opioid receptorNot AvailableHumansUMu-type opioid receptorNot AvailableHumansUPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gammaactivatorHumansUTransient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member activatorHumansUVoltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-GNot AvailableHumansUVoltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-HNot AvailableHumansUVoltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-INot AvailableHumansUTransient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member agonistHumansUTransient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member Not AvailableHumansUTransient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member activatorHumansUTransient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member activatorHumansUTransient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member activatorHumansUVoltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein Not AvailableHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor AantagonistHumansUAdenosine receptor AactivatorHumansUProstaglandin G/H synthase inhibitorHumansUProstaglandin G/H synthase inhibitorHumansUAcetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, mitochondrialinhibitorHumansUSteroid -alpha-hydroxylase/, lyaseinhibitorHumansU-hydroxy--methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductasestimulatorHumansUGlutathione reductase, mitochondrialstimulatorHumansUGlutathione peroxidase stimulatorHumansUIndoleamine ,-dioxygenase inhibitorHumansUCytochrome P BinhibitorHumansUNAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] inhibitorHumansUCatalaseinhibitorHumansUCytochrome P AinhibitorHumansUCytochrome P DinhibitorHumansUSuperoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn]inhibitorHumansUCytochrome P AinhibitorHumansUCytochrome P AinhibitorHumansUArylalkylamine N-acetyltransferaseinhibitorHumansUN-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidaseinhibitorHumans",[],"['Agents producing tachycardia', 'Agents that produce hypertension', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'BCRP/ABCG2 Inhibitors', 'Cannabinoids and similars', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Nervous System', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Agonists', 'Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Agonists', 'Serotonin Agents', 'Serotonin Receptor Agonists', 'Terpenes', 'UGT1A9 Inhibitors', 'UGT1A9 Substrates', 'UGT2B17 substrates', 'UGT2B7 Inhibitors', 'UGT2B7 substrates']"

The serotonin 5-HT3receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postremaLabel,3,4. The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents, suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tractLabel,3,4. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT3receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomitingLabel,3,4.Moreover, the effect of ondansetron on the QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled, crossover study in 58 healthy adult men and women11,12. Ondansetron was tested at single doses of 8 mg and 32 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes11,12. At the highest tested dose of 32 mg, prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QTc interval (QT/RR0.33=QTcF) was observed from 15 min to 4 h after the start of the 15 min infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 19.6 (21.5) msec at 20 min11,12. At the lower tested dose of 8 mg, QTc prolongation was observed from 15 min to 1 h after the start of the 15-minute infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 5.8 (7.8) msec at 15 min11,12. The magnitude of QTc prolongation with ondansetron is expected to be greater if the infusion rate is faster than 15 minutes11,12. The 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron must not be administered11,12. No treatment-related effects on the QRS duration or the PR interval were observed at either the 8 or 32 mg dose11,12.An ECG assessment study has not been performed for orally administered ondansetron11,12. On the basis of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling, an 8 mg oral dose of ondansetron is predicted to cause a mean QTcF increase of 0.7 ms (90% CI -2.1, 3.3) at steady-state, assuming a mean maximal plasma concentration of 24.7 ng/mL (95% CI 21.1, 29.0)11,12. The magnitude of QTc prolongation at the recommended 5 mg/m2 dose in pediatrics has not been studied, but pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling predicts a mean increase of 6.6 ms (90% CI 2.8, 10.7) at maximal plasma concentrations11,12.In healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time10.

However, the reports of various studies in rat and human tissue cultures lend support to the hypothesis that hydroxyurea causes an immediate inhibition of DNA synthesis, by acting as a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, without interfering with the synthesis of ribonucleic acid or of protein. Hydroxyurea probably acts by decreasing the rate of conversion of ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides. This effect is particularly apparent in cells with a high rate of proliferation.Particularly, hydroxyurea reduces the tyrosyl free radical at the active site of the M via a one-electron transfer reaction through the –NH-OH moiety.Three mechanisms have been postulated for the potentiation of the therapeutic effects of irradiation by hydroxyurea on squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinomas of the head and neck. In vitro studies utilizing Chinese hamster cells suggest that hydroxyurea is lethal to normally radioresistant S-stage cells and holds other cells of the cell cycle in the G or pre-DNA synthesis stage where they are most susceptible to the effects of irradiation. The third mechanism of action has been theorized on the basis of in vitro studies of HeLa cells: it appears that hydroxyurea, by inhibition of DNA synthesis, hinders the normal repair process of cells damaged but not killed by irradiation, thereby decreasing their survival rate; there is no alteration of RNA and protein syntheses.Another proposed mechanism of action of hydroxyurea is the elevation of HbF concentrations in Sickle Cell Disease patients. HbF interferes with the polymerization of HbS (sickle haemoglobin) and thus impedes the sickling of red blood cell. Recently, hydroxyurea has shown to be associated with the generation of nitric oxide, suggesting that nitric oxide stimulates cyclic guanosine monophosphates (cGMP) production, which then activates a protein kinase and increases the production of HbF. Other known pharmacological effects of hydroxycarbamide which may contribute to its beneficial effects in Sickle Cell Disease include decrease of neutrophils, improved deformability of sickled cells, and altered adhesion of red blood cells to the endothelium.TargetActionsOrganismARibonucleoside-diphosphate reductase large subunitinhibitorHumans","['Chemoradiotherapy', 'Radiation Therapy']","['Amides', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents', 'Antisickling Agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Hematologic Agents', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents', 'Myelosuppressive Agents', 'Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Substrates']"

The main effects reported in ibuprofen are related to the control of pain, fever and acute inflammation by the inhibition of the synthesis of prostanoids by COX-1 and COX-2.

Some reports have tried to link the pain regulation with a possible enhancement on the synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids and action on the NMDA receptors. The effect on pain has been shown to be related to the cortically evoked potentials.23The antipyretic effect is reported to be linked to the effect on the prostanoid synthesis due to the fact that the prostanoids are the main signaling mediator of pyresis in the hypothalamic-preoptic region.23The use of ibuprofen in dental procedures is attributed to the local inhibition of prostanoid production as well as to anti-oedemic activity and an increase of plasma beta-endorphins. Some reports have suggested a rapid local reduction of the expression of COX-2 in dental pulp derived by the administration of ibuprofen.23The administration of ibuprofen in patients with rheumatic diseases has shown to control joint symptoms.10Ibuprofen is largely used in OTC products such as an agent for the management of dysmenorrhea which has been proven to reduce the amount of menstrual prostanoids and to produce a reduction in the uterine hypercontractility.17As well, it has been reported to reduce significantly the fever and the pain caused by migraines.18,19This effect is thought to be related to the effect on platelet activation and thromboxane A2 production which produces local vascular effects in the affected regions. This effect is viable as ibuprofen can enter in the central nervous system.23In the investigational uses of ibuprofen, it has been reported to reduce neurodegeneration when given in low doses over a long time.20On the other hand, its use in Parkinson disease is related to the importance of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathology of this condition.21The use of ibuprofen for breast cancer is related to a study that shows a decrease of 50% in the rate of breast cancer.22",CC(C)CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C)C(O)=O,"The exact mechanism of action of ibuprofen is unknown.

There was a decrease in the risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by 90% but there was no increase in the risk of endometrial cancer. Unlike hormone replacement therapy, raloxifene does not mediate proliferative or stimulatory effects on endometrial tissue. Findings from both animal and human studies demonstrated no significant changes in the histologic appearance of the endometrium.7Raloxifene promotes estrogen-like effects on lipid metabolism. In a European trial that evaluated lipid profiles following raloxifene therapy over the 24-month period, there were significant decreases in the serum concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol over a 24-month period of raloxifene therapy.7Raloxifene is not associated with causing alterations in the serum levels of HDL cholesterol or triglycerides.7As the HDL choesterol level is considered a strong inverse predictor of cardiovascular disease in women, the cardioprotective effects of raloxifene were questioned. Due to limited data on the long-term trials, it is not possible to determine whether the small lipid effects produced by raloxifene correlate with a smaller degree of cardioprotective activity compared with hormone replacement therapy.7",OC1=CC=C(C=C1)C1=C(C(=O)C2=CC=C(OCCN3CCCCC3)C=C2)C2=C(S1)C=C(O)C=C2,"Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that acts as both an estrogen agonist and antagonist via differential effects on the tissue-specific estrogen receptors. Based on the findings of competitive binding assays, raloxifene displays binding affinity that is similar to that ofestradiol, the predominant circulating estrogen.Estrogens play variable roles at different tissues in females, including the bone, breasts, uterus and liver, by binding to the steroid nuclear hormone receptors, Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα) or Estrogen Receptor beta (ERβ).These receptors are normally bound to the Heat Shock Protein  (Hsp) when unbound to the ligand. Ligand binding induces a conformational change in the receptor that promotes dissociation of the receptor from Hsp, dimerization and translocation into the nucleus. This movement into the nucleus allows the receptor to bind to genomic locations based on sequence recognition of the DNA binding domain, also known as the Estrogen Response Elements (EREs).In bones, endogenous estrogens normally modulate multiple DNA response elements, including the gene-encoding transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which is a cytokine embedded in the bone matrix.TGF-β plays an important role in bone remodellingby working with other cytokines to induce production of osteoblasts, such as IL-, and attenuate the activity of osetoclasts. Estrogens typically maintain the bone integrity by inhibiting the cytokines that recruit osteoclasts and oppose the bone-resorbing, Ca+-mobilizing action of parathyroid hormone. In contrast, estrogens promote osteoblast proliferation, augment the production of TGF-β and bone morphogenic proteins, and inhibit apoptosis.Mimicking the action of endogenous estrogen in bone tissues, raloxifene binds to the estrogen receptor to influence gene transcription through interactions with the estrogen response element (ERE) and a distinct DNA target, the raloxifene response element (RRE).It occupies the same ER ligand binding site as estrogen.Upon binding, raloxifene induces a conformational change of the receptor, allowing mediation of direct binding to transcriptional elements by accessory proteins.

Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGEalso activates the EPreceptor, coupled to Gs, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member  (TRPV) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the PX purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGEact via EPto increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EPto further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EPreceptor which couples to Gs. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGIis known to play a role via its Gs-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.PGIand PGEcontribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EPreceptors.,Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are Gs-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway.

RA is an auto-immune disease characterized by high T-cell activity. T cells have two pathways to synthesize pyrimidines: the salvage pathways and the de novo synthesis. At rest, T lymphocytes meet their metabolic requirements by the salvage pathway. Activated lymphocytes need to expand their pyrimidine pool 7- to 8-fold, while the purine pool is expanded only 2- to 3-fold. To meet the need for more pyrimidines, activated T cells use the de novo pathway for pyrimidine synthesis. Therefore, activated T cells, which are dependent on de novo pyrimidine synthesis, will be more affected by leflunomide's inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase than other cell types that use the salvage pathway of pyrimidine synthesis.",CC1=C(C=NO1)C(=O)NC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(F)(F)F,"Leflunomide is a prodrug that is rapidly and almost completely metabolized following oral administration to its pharmacologically active metabolite, A . This metabolite is responsible for essentially all of the drug's activity in-vivo. The mechanism of action of leflunomide has not been fully determined, but appears to primarily involve regulation of autoimmune lymphocytes. It has been suggested that leflunomide exerts its immunomodulating effects by preventing the expansion of activated autoimmune lymphocytes via interferences with cell cycle progression. In-vitro data indicates that leflunomide interferes with cell cycle progression by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (a mitochondrial enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine ribonucleotide uridine monophosphate (rUMP)synthesis) and has antiproliferative activity. Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase consists of  domains: an α/β-barrel domain containing the active site and an α-helical domain that forms a tunnel leading to the active site. A  binds to the hydrophobic tunnel at a site near the flavin mononucleotide. Inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase by A  prevents production of rUMP by the de novo pathway; such inhibition leads to decreased rUMP levels, decreased DNA and RNA synthesis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and G cell cycle arrest. It is through this action that leflunomide inhibits autoimmune T-cell proliferation and production of autoantibodies by B cells. Since salvage pathways are expected to sustain cells arrested in the G phase, the activity of leflunomide is cytostatic rather than cytotoxic. Other effects that result from reduced rUMP levels include interference with adhesion of activated lymphocytes to the synovial vascular endothelial cells, and increased synthesis of immunosuppressive cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Leflunomide is also a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinases activate signalling pathways leading to DNA repair, apoptosis and cell proliferation.

In patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, insulin is unable to exert adequate effects on tissues and cells (i.e. insulin resistance)19and insulin deficiency may also be present.21Metformin reduces hepatic production of glucose, decreases the intestinal absorption of glucose, and enhances insulin sensitivity by increasing both peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. In contrast with drugs of the sulfonylurea class, which lead to hyperinsulinemia, the secretion of insulin is unchanged with metformin use.23Effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)HbA1c is an important periodic measure of glycemic control used to monitor diabetic patients. Fasting plasma glucose is also a useful and important measure of glycemic control. In a 29-week clinical trial of subjects diagnosed with type II diabetes, metformin decreased the fasting plasma glucose levels by an average of 59 mg/dL from baseline, compared to an average increase of 6.3 mg/dL from baseline in subjects taking a placebo.23Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was decreased by about 1.4% in subjects receiving metformin, and increased by 0.4% in subjects receiving placebo only.23",CN(C)C(=N)NC(N)=N,"Metformin's mechanisms of action are unique from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic drugs. Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production (also called gluconeogenesis), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increasing insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.It is well established that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, and it has since been generally postulated that its potent antidiabetic effects occur through this mechanism.,The above processes lead to a decrease in blood glucose, managing type II diabetes and exerting positive effects on glycemic control.After ingestion, the organic cation transporter- (OCT) is responsible for the uptake of metformin into hepatocytes (liver cells). As this drug is positively charged, it accumulates in cells and in the mitochondria because of the membrane potentials across the plasma membrane as well as the mitochondrial inner membrane. Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, preventing the production of mitochondrial ATP leading to increased cytoplasmic ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios.These changes activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism.Aside from this mechanism, AMPK can be activated by a lysosomal mechanism involving other activators. Following this process, increases in AMP:ATP ratio also inhibitfructose-,-bisphosphataseenzyme, resulting in the inhibition of gluconeogenesis, while also inhibitingadenylate cyclaseand decreasing the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP),a derivative of ATP used for cell signaling. Activated AMPK phosphorylates two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme, thereby inhibiting fat synthesis and leading to fat oxidation, reducing hepatic lipid stores and increasing liver sensitivity to insulin.In the intestines, metformin increases anaerobic glucose metabolism in enterocytes (intestinal cells), leading to reduced net glucose uptake and increased delivery of lactate to the liver. Recent studies have also implicated the gut as a primary site of action of metformin and suggest that the liver may not be as important for metformin action in patients with type  diabetes. Some of the ways metformin may play a role on the intestines is by promoting the metabolism of glucose by increasing glucagon-like peptide I (GLP-) as well as increasing gut utilization of glucose.In addition to the above pathway, the mechanism of action of metformin may be explained by other ways, and its exact mechanism of action has been under extensive study in recent years.,,,TargetActionsOrganismAElectron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, mitochondrialinhibitorHumansA'-AMP-activated protein kinase subunit beta-induceractivatorHumansUGlycerol--phosphate dehydrogenase [NAD(+)], cytoplasmicinhibitorHumans",[],"['Alimentary Tract and Metabolism', 'Amidines', 'Biguanides', 'Blood Glucose Lowering Agents', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Drugs Used in Diabetes', 'Guanidines', 'MATE 1 Substrates', 'MATE 2 Substrates', 'MATE substrates', 'OCT1 substrates', 'OCT2 Inhibitors', 'OCT2 Substrates', 'Oral Hypoglycemics']"

These actions, according, to various preparations, are listed below:General effectsProgesterone is the main hormone of the corpus luteum and the placenta. It acts on the uterus by changing the proliferative phase to the secretory phase of the endometrium (inner mucous lining of the uterus). This hormone, stimulated by a hormone calledluteinizing hormone(LH) is the main hormone during the secretory phase to prepare the corpus luteum and the endometrium for implantation of a fertilized ovum. As the luteal phase concludes, the progesterone hormone sends negative feedback to the anterior pituitary gland in the brain to decrease FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) levels. This prevents ovulation and maturation of oocytes (immature egg cells). The endometrium then prepares for pregnancy by increasing its vascularity (blood vessels) and stimulating mucous secretion. This process occurs by progesterone stimulating the endometrium to decrease endometrial proliferation, leading to a decreased uterine lining thickness, developing more complex uterine glands, collecting energy in the form of glycogen, and providing more uterine blood vessel surface area suitable for supporting a growing embryo. As opposed to cervical mucous changes observed during the proliferative phase and ovulation, progesterone decreases and thickens the cervical mucus, rendering it less elastic. This change occurs because the fertilization time period has passed, and a specific consistency of mucous amenable to sperm entry is no longer required16.Gelatinized capsulesProgesterone capsules are an oral dosage form of micronized progesterone which, chemically identical to progesterone of ovarian origin. Progesterone capsules have all the properties of endogenous progesterone with induction of a secretory phase endometrium with gestagenic, antiestrogenic, slightly antiandrogenic and anti-aldosterone effects24. Progesterone opposes the effects of estrogen on the uterus, and is beneficial in women with unopposed estrogen exposure, which carries an increased risk of malignancy24.Vaginal gel and vaginal insertThe gel preparation mimics the effects of naturally occurring progesterone. In the presence of adequate levels of estrogen, progesterone converts a proliferative endometrium into secretory endometrium. This means that the endometrium changes from a growing and thickening stage into a subsequent preparation stage for pregnancy, which involves further preparatory changes. Progesterone is necessary for the development of decidual tissue (specialized tissue amenable to supporting a possible pregnancy). Progesterone is required to increase endometrial receptivity for the implantation of a fertilized embryo. Once an embryo is implanted, progesterone helps to maintain the pregnancy20.Injection (intramuscular)Intramuscularly injected progesterone increases serum progesterone and aids in the prevention of endometrial tissue overgrowth due to unopposed estrogen (which leads to abnormal uterine bleeding and sometimes uterine cancer)18,25.

As a result of its binding its associated steroid hormone, progesterone, the progesterone receptor (PR) modulates the expression of genes that regulate the development, differentiation, and proliferation of target tissues. In humans, PR is found to be highly expressed in the stromal (connective tissue) cells during the secretory phase and during pregnancy.Progesterone may prevent pregnancy by changing the consistency of cervical mucus to be unfavorable for sperm penetration, and by inhibiting follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which normally causes ovulation.

DB00921,Buprenorphine,Buprenorphineis a partial opioid agonist used for management of severe pain that is not responsive to alternative treatments. Also used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction.,"['P41145', 'P35372', 'P41143', 'P41146']","Buprenorphine interacts predominately with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. In clinical settings, buprenorphine exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. In addition to analgesia, alterations in mood, euphoria and dysphoria, and drowsiness commonly occur. Buprenorphine depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils.DependenceBuprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset. Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.[F4718]WithdrawalAbrupt discontinuation of treatment is not recommended as it may result in an opioid withdrawal syndrome that may be delayed in onset. Signs and symptoms may include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.[F4718]Risk of Respiratory and Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression and OverdoseBuprenorphine has been associated with life-threatening respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all, post-marketing reports regarding coma and death involved misuse by self-injection or were associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressant, including alcohol. Use buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression).22Risk of Overdose in Opioid Naïve PatientsThere have been reported deaths of opioid-naïve individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic in opioid-naïve patients.22Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and SymptomsIf buprenorphine is started in opioid-dependent individuals, it will displace the other opioids and cause a phenomenon known as ""precipitated withdrawal"" which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms. Individuals must therefore be in a state of mild to moderate withdrawal before starting therapy with buprenorphine.Because it contains naloxone, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are also highly likely to produce marked and intense withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone.22Gastrointestinal EffectsBuprenorphine and other morphine-like opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility and cause constipation. Buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions and should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.22Effects on the Endocrine SystemOpioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date. Patients presenting with symptoms of androgen deficiency should undergo laboratory evaluation.22Adrenal InsufficiencyCases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.22Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic FunctionBuprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The doses of buprenorphine and naloxone in this fixed-dose combination product cannot be individually titrated, and hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine. Therefore, patients with severe hepatic impairment will be exposed to substantially higher levels of naloxone than patients with normal hepatic function. This may result in an increased risk of precipitated withdrawal at the beginning of treatment (induction) and may interfere with buprenorphine’s efficacy throughout treatment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the differential reduction of naloxone clearance compared to buprenorphine clearance is not as great as in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. However, buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended for initiation of (treatment induction) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment due to the increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. Buprenorphine/naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. However, patients should be carefully monitored and consideration given to the possibility of naloxone interfering with buprenorphine’s efficacy.22Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic EventsCases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated.22Orthostatic HypotensionLike other opioids, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients.Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid PressureBuprenorphine, like other opioids, may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased. Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation.Elevation of Intracholedochal PressureBuprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.",CO[C@]12CC[C@@]3(C[C@@H]1[C@](C)(O)C(C)(C)C)[C@H]1CC4=C5C(O[C@@H]2[C@@]35CCN1CC1CC1)=C(O)C=C4,"Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor. It demonstrates a high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor but has lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists such asheroin,oxycodone, ormethadone.This means that buprenorphine preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the ""ceiling effect"" where once a certain dose is reached buprenorphine's effects plateau. This effect can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared tomethadoneand other full agonist opioids.,It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.Buprenorphine's high affinity, but low intrinsic activity for the mu-opioid receptor also means that if it is started in opioid-dependent individuals, it will displace the other opioids without creating an equal opioid effect and cause a phenomenon known as ""precipitated withdrawal"" which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms (i.e. anxiety, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, diaphoresis, intense drug cravings, and tachycardia). Individuals must therefore be in a state of mild to moderate withdrawal before starting therapy with buprenorphine.Buprenorphine is commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated in a : fixed-dose combination product along withnaloxone, a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination of an opioid agonist with an opioid antagonist may seem counterintuitive, however this combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously.,TargetActionsOrganismAKappa-type opioid receptorantagonistHumansAMu-type opioid receptorpartial agonistHumansUDelta-type opioid receptorantagonistHumansUNociceptin receptorNot AvailableHumans",[],"['Alkaloids', 'Analgesics', 'BCRP/ABCG2 Inhibitors', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C18 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs Used in Addictive Disorders', 'Drugs Used in Opioid Dependence', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Mixed Agonist / Antagonist Opioids', 'Morphinans', 'Narcotics', 'Nervous System', 'Opiate Agonists', 'Opiate Alkaloids', 'Opiate Partial Agonists', 'Opioid Antagonists', 'Opioids', 'Oripavine Derivatives', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Phenanthrenes', 'Sensory System Agents', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'UGT1A1 Substrates', 'UGT1A9 Substrates']"

DB01076,Atorvastatin,Atorvastatinis an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor used to lower lipid levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction and stroke.,"['P04035', 'P27487', 'P35869', 'Q92769', 'Q14994']","Atorvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent that reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease, and high ratios are associated with a higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.21,9,10,27Elevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.9Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 36-53%.3In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, atorvastatin reduced the levels of intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol.2It has also been suggested that atorvastatin can limit the extent of angiogenesis, which can be useful in the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma.1Myopathy/RhabdomyolysisAtorvastatin, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is associated with a risk of drug-induced myopathy characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness in conjunction with elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK). Myopathy often manifests as rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria. The risk of statin-induced myopathy is dose-related, and the symptoms of myopathy are typically resolved upon drug discontinuation. Results from observational studies suggest that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.30Liver DysfunctionStatins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. This effect appears to be dose-related.41,42Endocrine EffectsStatins are associated with a risk of increased serum HbA1c and glucose levels. Anin vitrostudy demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreatic islet β cells following treatment with atorvastatin. Moreover, insulin secretion rates decreased relative to control.7HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and may theoretically interfere with the production of adrenal and/or gonadal steroids. Clinical studies with atorvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not affect plasma cortisol concentrations, basal plasma testosterone concentration, or adrenal reserve. However, the effect of statins on male fertility has not been fully investigated. The effects of statins on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.42CardiovascularSignificant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with atorvastatin and other statins have been observed.

It pauses cells at theG/Mphases, when present at concentrations close to the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC). Microtubules, which are derived from polymers of tubulin, are the main target of vinorelbine.The chemical modification used to produce vinorelbine allows for the opening of the eight-member catharanthine ring with the formation of both a covalent and reversible bond with tubulin.The relative contribution of different microtubule-associated proteins in the production of tubulin vary between neural tissue and proliferating cells and this has important functional implications. The ability of vinorelbine to bind specifically to mitotic rather than other microtubules has been shown and may suggest that neurotoxicity is less likely to be a problem than with the molecular mechanism of action.As with other anti-microtubule agents, vinorelbine is known to contribute apoptosis in malignant cells. The exact mechanisms by which this process occurs are complex and many details are yet to be elucidated. The disarray of the microtubule structure has a number of effects, including the induction of tumor suppressor genepand activation/inactivation of a number of protein kinases involved in essential signaling pathways, includingp WAF/CIPandRas/Raf,PKC/PKA. These molecular changes lead to phosphorylation and consequently inactivation of the apoptosis inhibitorBcl. This, in turn, results in a decrease in the formation of heterodimers betweenBcland the pro-apoptotic geneBAX, stimulating the sequence of cell apoptosis.Vinorelbine tartrate also possibly interferes with amino acid, cyclic AMP and glutathione metabolism, calmodulin-dependent Ca++-transport ATPase activity, cellular respiration, and nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis.TargetActionsOrganismATubulin beta chainantagonistinhibitorHumans",[],"['Alkaloids', 'Antimitotic Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic', 'Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents', 'Cardiotoxic antineoplastic agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Indole Alkaloids', 'Indoles', 'Indolizidines', 'Indolizines', 'Mitosis Modulators', 'Myelosuppressive Agents', 'Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs', 'Neurotoxic agents', 'Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids', 'Tubulin Modulators', 'Vinca Alkaloids']"

By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.15,21Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.15Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.16,17,18,26,31Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.15,21Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.19,20Skeletal Muscle EffectsCases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥ 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such asfenofibrateorniacin),gemfibrozil,cyclosporine,atazanavir/ritonavir,lopinavir/ritonavir, orsimeprevir. Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered withcolchicine, and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.46Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.41Liver Enzyme AbnormalitiesIncreases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.46Endocrine EffectsIncreases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.46An in vitro study found thatatorvastatin,pravastatin,rosuvastatin, andpitavastatinexhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.40HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.47CardiovascularUbiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.47Lipoprotein AIn some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.47Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.23",CC(C)C1=NC(=NC(C2=CC=C(F)C=C2)=C1\C=C\[C@@H](O)C[C@@H](O)CC(=O)O)N(C)S(C)(=O)=O,"Rosuvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (-hydroxy--methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.Rosuvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL.In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β integrin function-associated antigen- (LFA-), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide,,by upregulating NOSand by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid.TargetActionsOrganismA-hydroxy--methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductaseinhibitorHumansUIntegrin alpha-Linhibitory allosteric modulatorHumans","['Lipid-Lowering Therapy', 'Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases']","['Agents Causing Muscle Toxicity', 'Alimentary Tract and Metabolism', 'Amides', 'Anticholesteremic Agents', 'BCRP/ABCG2 Substrates', 'BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs Used in Diabetes', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Fluorobenzenes', 'Genito Urinary System and Sex Hormones', 'Gynecological Antiinfectives and Antiseptics', 'Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated', 'Hydrocarbons, Halogenated', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Hypolipidemic Agents', 'Hypolipidemic Agents Indicated for Hyperlipidemia', 'Lipid Modifying Agents', 'Lipid Modifying Agents, Plain', 'Lipid Regulating Agents', 'OAT3/SLC22A8 Inhibitors', 'OAT3/SLC22A8 Substrates', 'OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors', 'OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Substrates', 'Pyrimidines', 'Sulfonamides', 'Sulfones', 'Sulfur Compounds']"

Bupivacaine is often administered by spinal injection prior to total hip arthroplasty. It is also commonly injected into surgical wound sites to reduce pain for up to 20 hours after surgery. In comparison to other local anesthetics it has a long duration of action. It is also the most toxic to the heart when administered in large doses. This problem has led to the use of other long-acting local anaesthetics:ropivacaine and levobupivacaine. Levobupivacaine is a derivative, specifically an enantiomer, of bupivacaine. Systemic absorption of local anesthetics produces effects on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. At blood concentrations achieved with therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmias and to cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in fatalities. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. Following systemic absorption, local anesthetics can produce central nervous system stimulation, depression or both.",CCCCN1CCCCC1C(=O)NC1=C(C)C=CC=C1C,"Likelidocaine, bupivacaine is an amide local anesthetic that provides local anesthesia through blockade of nerve impulse generation and conduction.These impulses, also known as action potentials, critically depend on membrane depolarization produced by the influx of sodium ions into the neuron through voltage-gated sodium channels.Bupivacaine crosses the neuronal membrane and exerts its anesthetic action through blockade of these channels at the intracellular portion of their pore-forming transmembrane segments.The block is use-dependent, where repetitive or prolonged depolarization increases sodium channel blockade.,Without sodium ions passing through the channel’s pore, bupivacaine stabilizes the membrane at rest and therefore prevents neurotransmission.In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers.Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: () pain, () temperature, () touch, () proprioception, and () skeletal muscle tone.While it is well-established that the main action of bupivacaine is through sodium channel block, additional analgesic effects of bupivacaine are thought to potentially be due to its binding to the prostaglandin E receptors, subtype EP (PGEEP), which inhibits the production of prostaglandins, thereby reducing fever, inflammation, and hyperalgesia.,TargetActionsOrganismASodium channel protein type  subunit alphainhibitorHumansUProstaglandin E receptor EP subtypeother/unknownHumans","['General Anesthesia', 'Local Anaesthesia therapy', 'Regional nerve block therapy']","['Agents that reduce seizure threshold', 'Amides', 'Amines', 'Anesthetics', 'Anesthetics, Local', 'Anilides', 'Aniline Compounds', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'Local Anesthesia', 'Local Anesthetics (Amide)', 'Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents', 'Nervous System', 'Neuraxial Anesthetics', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Sensory System Agents']"

Another study showed pyridoxine hydrochloride to inhibit ADP- or epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation and to lower total cholesterol levels and increase HDL-cholesterol levels, again in a small group of subjects. Vitamin B6, in the form of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, was found to protect vascular endothelial cells in culture from injury by activated platelets. Endothelial injury and dysfunction are critical initiating events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Human studies have demonstrated that vitamin B6 deficiency affects cellular and humoral responses of the immune system.

Protease inhibitors block the part of HIV called protease. HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Ritonavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs. Modern protease inhibitors require the use of low-dose ritonavir to boost pharmacokinetic exposure through inhibition of metabolism via the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme pathway.,CC(C)[C@H](NC(=O)N(C)CC1=CSC(=N1)C(C)C)C(=O)N[C@H](C[C@H](O)[C@H](CC1=CC=CC=C1)NC(=O)OCC1=CN=CS1)CC1=CC=CC=C1,"Ritonavic inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme that normally cleaves the structural and replicative proteins that arise from major HIV genes, such asgagandpol.Gagencodes proteins involved in the core and the nucleocapsid, whilepolencodes the the HIV reverse transcriptase, ribonuclease H, integrase, and protease.

Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P CYPA isoenzyme present both in the intestinal tract and liver. It is a type II ligand that perfectly fits into the CYPA active site cavity and irreversibly binds to the heme iron via the thiazole nitrogen, which decreases the redox potential of the protein and precludes its reduction with the redox partner, cytochrome P reductase.

Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity, the transmission of nerve impulses, the contraction of cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle, and the maintenance of normal renal function. The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane. Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day. Potassium depletion will occur whenever the rate of potassium loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the rate of potassium intake. Such depletion usually develops as a consequence of therapy with diuretics, primarily or secondary hyperaldosteronism, diabetic ketoacidosis, or inadequate replacement of potassium in patients on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Depletion can develop rapidly with severe diarrhea, especially if associated with vomiting. Potassium depletion due to these causes is usually accompanied by concomitant loss of chloride and is manifested by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Potassium depletion may produce weakness, fatigue, disturbances of cardiac rhythm (primarily ectopic beats), prominent U-waves in the electrocardiogram, and, in advanced cases, flaccid paralysis and/or impaired ability to concentrate urine. If potassium depletion associated with metabolic alkalosis cannot be managed by correcting the fundamental cause of the deficiency, e.g., where the patient requires long-term diuretic therapy, supplemental potassium in the form of high potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels. In rare circumstances (e.g., patients with renal tubular acidosis) potassium depletion may be associated with metabolic acidosis and hyperchloremia.

Lithium's therapeutic action may be due to a number of effects, ranging from inhibition of enzymes such as glycogen synthase kinase 3, inositol phosphatases, or modulation of glutamate receptors.",[Li+],"The precise mechanism of action of Li+ as a mood-stabilizing agent is currently unknown. It is possible that Li+ produces its effects by interacting with the transport of monovalent or divalent cations in neurons. An increasing number of scientists have come to the conclusion that the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is the key factor in understanding how lithium works. Lithium has been shown to change the inward and outward currents of glutamate receptors (especially GluR), without a shift in reversal potential. Lithium has been found to exert a dual effect on glutamate receptors, acting to keep the amount of glutamate active between cells at a stable, healthy level, neither too much nor too little. It is postulated that too much glutamate in the space between neurons causes mania, and too little, depression. Another mechanism by which lithium might help to regulate mood include the non-competitive inhibition of an enzyme called inositol monophosphatase. Alternately lithium's action may be enhanced through the deactivation of the GSK-B enzyme. The regulation of GSK-B by lithium may affect the circadian clock. GSK- is known for phosphorylating and thus inactivating glycogen synthase. GSK-B has also been implicated in the control of cellular response to damaged DNA. GSK- normally phosphorylates beta catenin, which leads to beta catenin degratation. When GSK- is inhibited, beta catenin increases and transgenic mice with overexpression of beta catenin express similar behaviour to mice treated with lithium. These results suggest that increase of beta catenin may be a possible pathway for the therapeutic action of lithium.TargetActionsOrganismUGlycogen synthase kinase- betainhibitorHumansUInositol monophosphatase inhibitorHumansUInositol monophosphatase inhibitorHumansUGlutamate receptor potentiatorHumans",[],"['Antidepressive Agents', 'Antimanic Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Highest Risk QTc-Prolonging Agents', 'Lithium Compounds', 'Mood Stabilizer', 'Nephrotoxic agents', 'Neurotoxic agents', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'QTc Prolonging Agents', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Serotonin Agents', 'Serotonin Modulators']"

The mechanism is thought to be a dose-independent and immune-mediated reaction against neutrophils.6Patients are strictly monitored by lab testing (complete blood count with differential) to ensure agranulocytosis is detected and treated if it occurs.27Testing is initially completed at one-week intervals but is expanded to two-week intervals at six months, and then four-week intervals at twelve months if lab results have been within an appropriate range. Monitoring parameters may change if there is any break in therapy. In Canada, the patient's lab values are reported to the manufacturer for hematological monitoring, and in the USA, the patient's lab values are reported to the REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.7These programs function to notify the care provider of any significant drop in WBC/neutrophil count, or if there is a drop below a threshold level.

However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of clozapine in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type  (D) and the serotonin type A (-HTA) receptors. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors.Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H (Ki . nM), adrenergic αA (Ki . nM), serotonin -HT (Ki  nM), serotonin -HTA (Ki . nM), muscarinic M (Ki . nM), serotonin -HT (Ki . nM), serotonin -HTC (Ki . nM), dopamine D (Ki  nM), adrenergic αA (Ki  nM), serotonin -HT (Ki  nM), serotonin -HTA (Ki  nM), dopamine D (Ki  nM), dopamine D (Ki  nM), dopamine D (Ki  nM), and dopamine D (Ki  nM).Clozapine acts as an antagonist at other receptors, but with lower potency. Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and HTwith similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of clozapine. Clozapine's antagonism of muscarinic M- receptors may explain its anticholinergic effects.Clozapine's antagonism of histamine H receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug.Clozapine's antagonism of adrenergic α receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug.TargetActionsOrganismUDopamine D receptorantagonistHumansADopamine D receptorantagonistHumansUDopamine D receptorantagonistHumansUDopamine D receptorantagonistHumansUDopamine D receptorbinderHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor AantagonistHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor BantagonistHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor DantagonistHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor EantagonistHumansA-hydroxytryptamine receptor AantagonistHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor AantagonistHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor CantagonistHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonistHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonistHumansNAlpha-C adrenergic receptorantagonistHumansUHistamine H receptorantagonistHumansNHistamine H receptorantagonistHumansUAlpha-A adrenergic receptorantagonistHumansNAlpha-B adrenergic receptorantagonistHumansUAlpha-A adrenergic receptorantagonistHumansNAlpha-B adrenergic receptorantagonistHumansUMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor Mpartial agonistHumansUMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor Mpartial agonistHumansUMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor MantagonistHumansUMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor Mpartial agonistHumansUMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor MantagonistHumansUNeuron-specific vesicular protein calcyonunknownHumansUGlutathione S-transferase PNot AvailableHumansUGamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit positive modulatorHumansUGamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit positive modulatorHumansUGamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-antagonistHumansUGamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit beta-antagonistHumansUGamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit gamma-antagonistHumans",[],"['Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists', 'Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists', 'Adrenergic Antagonists', 'Agents producing tachycardia', 'Agents that produce hypertension', 'Agents that reduce seizure threshold', 'Anticholinergic Agents', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents (Second Generation [Atypical])', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Diazepines, Oxazepines, Thiazepines and Oxepines', 'Dibenzazepines', 'Dopamine Antagonists', 'Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists', 'Drugs causing inadvertant photosensitivity', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'GABA Agents', 'GABA Antagonists', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Histamine Antagonists', 'Histamine H1 Antagonists', 'Hyperglycemia-Associated Agents', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'Moderate Risk QTc-Prolonging Agents', 'Muscarinic Antagonists', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotoxic agents', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'OCT1 substrates', 'P-glycoprotein substrates', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Psycholeptics', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'QTc Prolonging Agents', 'Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Antagonists', 'Serotonin 5-HT1A Receptor Antagonists', 'Serotonin 5-HT1D Receptor Antagonists', 'Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Antagonists', 'Serotonin 5-HT2A Receptor Antagonists', 'Serotonin 5-HT2C Receptor Antagonists', 'Serotonin Agents', 'Serotonin Receptor Antagonists', 'Tranquilizing Agents', 'UGT1A4 substrates']"

Intracellular enzymes subsequently eliminate the HIV particle that previously had been uncoated, and left unprotected, during entry into the host cell.

Thimerosal, which consists of approximately 50% mercury by weight, has been one of the most widely used preservatives in vaccines. It is metabolized/degraded to ethylmercury and thiosalicylate. Ethylmercury is an organomercurial that must be carefully distinguished from methylmercury, a closely related substance that has been the focus of many studies. Methylmercury is the type of mercury found in various species of fish21. Experimental data demonstrates that the toxicokinetics of thimerosal (ethylmercury) is vastly different from that of methyl-mercury. Thus, methyl-mercury is not a suitable reference for assessing the risk from exposure to thimerosal-derived mercury24.Prior to the recent initiative to reduce or eliminate thimerosal from childhood vaccines, the maximum cumulative exposure to mercury via routine childhood vaccinations during the first 6 months of life was 187.5 micrograms. In the most recently formulated vaccines, the maximum cumulative exposure during the first 6 months of life should now be less than 3 micrograms of mercury. Currently, thimerosal may still be used in the early stages of manufacturing of certain childhood vaccines, however, only a trace remains after a chemical purification process. Note that the dose above is indicated for children 1-6 months of age is applicable only in the United States, and other countries may have varying indications20.",[Na+].CC[Hg]SC1=CC=CC=C1C([O-])=O,"Although its mechanism of action is not fully understood, thimerosal inhibits sulfhydryl-containing active site of various enzymes and binds to sulfhydryl compounds, including glutathione, cysteine, and sulfhydryl groups of proteins. In addition, thimerosal activates the InsP calcium channel on the endoplasmic reticular membrane, thereby triggering the release of intracellular calcium resulting in a calcium-induced calcium-influx of extracellular calcium. Therefore, thimerosal may induce or inhibit various cellular functions that are dependent on the signaling of calcium.Ethylmercury is metabolized to inorganic mercury more rapidly than methylmercury. This difference in metabolism may account for kidney pathology that can result from toxic quantities. Also, whereas the increase in oxidative stress and induction of apoptosis observed in vitro with large doses ( μg/L to  mg/L) of thimerosal may explain its damaging neurological effects. The effects of low-dose ethylmercury are not completely understood to date. It is known, however, that the shorter half-life of ethylmercury (the metabolite of thimerosal) allows for very limited opportunities of ethylmercury derived from thimerosal in vaccines.Ethylmercury is a lipophilic cation that is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. The octanol/water partition coefficients of methyl and ethylmercury are . to ., at intracellular pH and [Cl−], therefore, both organomercury compounds will primarily exist as intracellular lipophilic cations. It has been demonstrated that lipophilic cations accumulate inside mitochondria, in a Nernstian fashion, driven by the steady state membrane potential. As the typical mitochondrial membrane potential of astrocytes and neurons is between – mV, one would expect the concentration of these organomercury compounds within mitochondria to be approximately  times greater than the cytosolic concentration.TargetActionsOrganismUMethionine synthaseantagonistHumansUCystine/glutamate transporterantagonistHumansUSodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit gammaantagonistHumans",['Skin disinfection'],"['Alkylmercury Compounds', 'Antiseptics and Disinfectants', 'Cell-mediated Immunity', 'Compounds used in a research, industrial, or household setting', 'Dermatologicals', 'Ethylmercury Compounds', 'Increased Histamine Release', 'Mercurial Products', 'Organomercury Compounds', 'Organometallic Compounds', 'Pharmaceutic Aids', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preservatives, Pharmaceutical', 'Standardized Chemical Allergen']"

The essential amino acid L-tryptophan is a precursor in the synthesis of melatonin. It helps regulate sleep-wake cycles or the circadian rhythm. Production of melatonin is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light. High levels of melatonin induce sleep and so consumption of the drug can be used to combat insomnia and jet lag.
MT1 and MT2 receptors may be a target for the treatment of circadian and non circadian sleep disorders because of their differences in pharmacology and function within the SCN. SCN is responsible for maintaining the 24 hour cycle which regulates many different body functions ranging from sleep to immune functions",COC1=CC2=C(NC=C2CCNC(C)=O)C=C1,"Melatonin is a derivative of tryptophan. It binds to melatonin receptor type A, which then acts on adenylate cylcase and the inhibition of a cAMP signal transduction pathway. Melatonin not only inhibits adenylate cyclase, but it also activates phosphilpase C. This potentiates the release of arachidonate. By binding to melatonin receptors  and , the downstream signallling cascades have various effects in the body. The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body. There are two subtypes of the receptor in humans, melatonin receptor  (MT) and melatonin receptor  (MT). Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, on market or in clinical trials, all bind to and activate both receptor types.The binding of the agonists to the receptors has been investigated for over two decades or since . It is somewhat known, but still not fully understood. When melatonin receptor agonists bind to and activate their receptors it causes numerous physiological processes.
MT receptors are expressed in many regions of the central nervous system (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SNC), hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.
The binding of melatonin to melatonin receptors activates a few signaling pathways. MT receptor activation inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and its inhibition causes a rippling effect of non activation; starting with decreasing formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and then progressing to less protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which in turn hinders the phosphorilation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB binding protein) into P-CREB. MT receptors also activate phospholipase C (PLC), affect ion channels and regulate ion flux inside the cell. The binding of melatonin to MT receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP.[] As well it hinders guanylyl cyclase and therefore the forming of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Binding to MT receptors probably affects PLC which increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity.

Its therapeutic action does not involve pituitary-adrenal stimulation.13Indometacin primarily works by suppressing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis by providing relief of pain as well as reducing fever, swelling, and tenderness. This effectiveness has been demonstrated by a reduction in the extent of joint swelling, the average number of joints displaying symptoms of inflammation, and the severity of morning stiffness. Increased mobility was demonstrated by a decrease in total walking time and by improved functional capability seen as an increase in grip strength.13In clinical trials, indometacin was shown to be effective in relieving the pain, reducing the fever, swelling, redness, and tenderness of acute gouty arthritis. Due to its pharmacological actions, the use of indometacin is associated with the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as gastrointestinal effects such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines.13In a study of healthy individuals, acute oral and intravenous indometacin therapy resulted in a transiently diminished basal and CO2 stimulated cerebral blood flow; this effect disappeared in one study after one week of oral treatment.13The clinical significance of this effect has not been established. Compared to other NSAIDs, it is suggested that indometacin is a more potent vasoconstrictor that is more consistent in decreasing cerebral blood flow and inhibiting CO2 reactivity.1There have been studies that show indometacin directly inhibiting neuronal activity to some extent in the trigeminocervical complex after either superior salivatory nucleus or dural stimulation.1",COC1=CC2=C(C=C1)N(C(=O)C1=CC=C(Cl)C=C1)C(C)=C2CC(O)=O,"Indometacin is a nonspecific and reversible inhibitor of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme or prostaglandin G/H synthase. There are two identified isoforms of COX: COX- is universally present in most body tissues and is involved in the synthesis of the prostaglandins and thromboxane A, while COX- is expressed in response to injury or inflammation.Constitutively expressed, the COX- enzyme is involved in gastric mucosal protection, platelet, and kidney function by catalyzing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) G and PGG to PGH.COX- is constitutively expressed and highly inducible by inflammatory stimuli. It is found in the central nervous system, kidneys, uterus, and other organs. COX- also catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG and PGG to PGH. In the COX--mediated pathway, PGH is further converted to PGE and PGI (also known as prostacyclin). PGE is involved in mediating inflammation, pain, and fever. Decreasing levels of PGE leads to reduced inflammatory reactions. Indometacin is known to inhibit both isoforms of COX, however, with greater selectivity for COX-, which accounts for its increased adverse gastric effects relative to other NSAIDs. It binds to the enzyme's active site and prevents the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate, arachidonic acid. Indometacin, unlike other NSAIDs, also inhibits phospholipase A, the enzyme responsible for releasing arachidonic acid from phospholipids. The analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of indomethacin as well as adverse reactions associated with the drug occur as a result of decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Its antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.The exact mechanism of action of indometacin in inducing closure of a patent ductus arteriosus is not fully understood; however, it is thought to be through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.At birth, the ductus arteriosus is normally closed as the tension of the oxygen increases significantly after birth.Patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants is associated with congenital heart malformations where PGE mediates an opposite effect to that of oxygen. PGE dilates the ductus arteriosus through smooth muscle relaxation and prevents the closure of the ductus arteriosus.By inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, indometacin promotes the closure of ductus arteriosus.Indometacin has been described as possessing anticancer and antiviral properties through activation of protein kinase R (PKR) and downstream phosphorylation of eIFα, inhibiting protein synthesis.,TargetActionsOrganismAProstaglandin G/H synthase inhibitorHumansAPhospholipase A, membrane associatedinhibitorHumansUProstaglandin G/H synthase inhibitorHumansUProstaglandin reductase inhibitorHumansUPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gammaactivatorHumansULactoylglutathione lyaseinhibitorHumansUProstaglandin D receptor other/unknownHumansUPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alphaagonistHumansUAldo-keto reductase family  member CinhibitorHumansUInterferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinaseinducerHumansAHuman CyclooxygenasesinhibitorHumans",[],"['Acetic Acid Derivatives and Related Substances', 'Agents causing hyperkalemia', 'Agents that produce hypertension', 'Analgesics', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal (Non-Selective)', 'Antigout Preparations', 'Antiinflammatory and Antirheumatic Products', 'Antiinflammatory and Antirheumatic Products, Non-Steroids', 'Antiinflammatory Preparations, Non-Steroids for Topical Use', 'Antirheumatic Agents', 'BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates', 'Cardiac Therapy', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Hypoglycemia-Associated Agents', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Indoles', 'Musculo-Skeletal System', 'Myelosuppressive Agents', 'Nephrotoxic agents', 'Non COX-2 selective NSAIDS', 'OAT1/SLC22A6 inhibitors', 'OAT1/SLC22A6 Substrates', 'OAT3/SLC22A8 Inhibitors', 'OAT3/SLC22A8 Substrates', 'OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors', 'Ophthalmologicals', 'Other Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'P-glycoprotein substrates', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Sensory Organs', 'Sensory System Agents', 'Tocolytic Agents', 'Topical Products for Joint and Muscular Pain', 'UGT1A1 Inhibitors', 'UGT1A1 Substrates', 'UGT1A9 Substrates', 'UGT2B7 Inhibitors', 'UGT2B7 substrates']"

These metabolites cause cell injury by two different mechanisms. First, FdUMP and the folate cofactor, N--methylenetetrahydrofolate (CHTHF), bind to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex.TS is an enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP).,Under normal physiological conditions, dUMP binds to TS first before CHTHF, followed by a , or Michael addition from the pyrimidine C ()atom to the Cys nucleophile.,If correctly positioned, dUMP, CHTHF, and TS would form a ternary complex to facilitate the donation of the methyl group from CHTHF to dUMP.However, the substitution of dUMP with FdUMP results in a new time-dependent TS–FdUMP–CHTHF complex. Since the fluorine group prevents dissociation of FdUMP from the pyrimidine ring, the whole complex is rendered irreversibly deactivated, terming this reaction ""suicide inhibition"".,TS inhibition prevents the conversion of dUMP to dTMP, depleting the pool of dTMP that could be phosphorylated into dTTP to be incorporated as DNA nucleotides. This disrupts the nucleotides balance, particularly the the ATP/dTTP ratio, thus impairing DNA synthesis and repair and causing apoptosis.,-FdUMP can also be phosphorylated into -FdUTP, further increasing the pool of dUTP base to potentially overwhelm the activity of dUTPase.Coupled with the decrease in dTTP, -FdUMP, and -FdUTP increase the probability of mistakenly incorporating a uracil base into DNA strands in place of thymine. Although this mistake can often be resolved by the nucleotide excision repair enzyme uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UDG), the high (F)dUTP/dTTP ratio would result in re-incorporation of uracil into DNA, leading to a futile cycle of misincorporation, excision, and repair.,Repeated base excision repair can result in abasic sites, which can lead to DNA mutagenesis and thus protein miscoding, replication forks collapse, and DNA fragmentation through single or double strand breaks,,,However, several reports have found that the incorporation of uracil in genomic DNA does not significantly affect the cytotoxicity of -FU, suggesting that the cytotoxic effect of -FU is dominated by the perturbation of RNA through -FUTP.,Similar to -dFUTP, -FUTP can be mistakenly incorporated into RNA in place of regular UTP and disrupt regular RNA biology through various mechanisms. -FUTP can be incorporated into the spliceosomal U snRNA at pseudouridylated sites to prevent further pseudouridylation and thus pre-mrNA splicing. -FUTP can also change the structure of U and U snRNA and reduce the turnover rate of U snrNA once incorporated.For tRNA, -FUTP can affect tRNA's post-transcriptional RNA modifications activity, particularly by inhbiting pseudouridine synthase through formation of covalent complex.,Recently, the effect of -FUTP on miRNAs and lncRNA was also observed through profound changes in expression, although the precise mechanism is still unknown.,,Although the main mechanism of -FU cytotoxicity was thought to be attributed to DNA damages, recent reports have shown that the majority of -FU pharmacological action is mediated through RNA, since -FU is accumulated ~- to  -fold more in RNA compared to that of DNA.TargetActionsOrganismADNAincorporation into and destabilizationinhibition of synthesisHumansARNAincorporation into and destabilizationHumansAThymidylate synthaseinhibitorHumans",['Chemotherapy'],"['Antimetabolites', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents', 'Cardiotoxic antineoplastic agents', 'Cytidine Deaminase Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors (strong)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Fluoropyrimidines', 'Fluorouracil and prodrugs', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Myelosuppressive Agents', 'Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs', 'Noxae', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Nucleic Acids, Nucleotides, and Nucleosides', 'Nucleoside Metabolic Inhibitor', 'Pyrimidine Analogues', 'Toxic Actions']"

Incorporation of dFdCTP into the DNA chain ultimately leads to chain termination, DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic cell death of malignant cells.,,Gemcitabine has self-potentiating pharmacological actions that can increase the probability of successful incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into the DNA chain: dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the reactions that generate dCTP for DNA synthesis. Since dFdCDP reduces the levels of dCTP, there is less competition for gemcitabine triphosphate for incorporation into DNA.,Gemcitabine can also reduce metabolism and elimination of active metabolites from the target cel, prolonging high intracellular concentrations of the active metabolites.

Irinotecan is a semisynthetic derivative of camptothecin. Camptothecins interact specifically with topoisomerase I, an enzyme in the cell nucleus that regulates DNA topology and facilitates nuclear processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and repair. During these processes, topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks, allowing single DNA strands to pass through the break. The 3'-DNA terminus of the broken DNA strands bind covalently with the topoisomerase enzyme to form a catalytic intermediate called a cleavable complex. After the DNA is sufficiently relaxed and the strand passage reaction is complete, DNA topoisomerase reattaches the broken DNA strands to form the chemically unaltered topoisomers that allow transcription to proceed. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either Irinotecan or SN-38. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-strand breaks. The precise contribution of SN-38 to the activity of irinotecan in humans is not known.

The first hydroxylation of vitamin D3 cholecalciferol (or D2) occurs in the liver to yield 25-hydroxyvitamin D while the second hydroxylation happens in the kidneys to give 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D12,13,14. These vitamin D metabolites subsequently facilitate the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine, serving to increase serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to allow bone mineralization12,13,14. Conversely, these vitamin D metabolites also assist in mobilizing calcium and phosphate from bone and likely increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate via the renal tubules12,13,14. There exists a period of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of cholecalciferol and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active vitamin D metabolites in the liver and kidneys12,13,14. It is parathyroid hormone that is responsible for the regulation of such metabolism at the level of the kidneys12,13,14.",CC(C)CCC[C@@H](C)[C@@]1([H])CC[C@@]2([H])\C(CCC[C@]12C)=C\C=C1\C[C@@H](O)CCC1=C,"Most individuals naturally generate adequate amounts of vitamin D through ordinary dietary intake of vitamin D (in some foods like eggs, fish, and cheese) and natural photochemical conversion of the vitamin D precursor -dehydrocholesterol in the skin via exposure to sunlight,,,.Conversely, vitamin D deficiency can often occur from a combination of insufficient exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D, genetic defects with endogenous vitamin D receptor, or even severe liver or kidney disease. Such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone. Increases in parathyroid hormone stimulate the mobilization of skeletal calcium and the renal excretion of phosphorus. This enhanced mobilization of skeletal calcium leads towards porotic bone conditions.Ordinarily, while vitamin D is made naturally via photochemical processes in the skin, both itself and vitamin D can be found in various food and pharmaceutical sources as dietary supplements. The principal biological function of vitamin D is the maintenance of normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus in the bloodstream by enhancing the efficacy of the small intestine to absorb these minerals from the diet. At the liver, vitamin D or D is hydroxylated to -hydroxyvitamin D and then finally to the primary active metabolite ,-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney via further hydroxylation,. This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma,.In particular, calcitriol interacts with vitamin D receptors in the small intestine to enhance the efficiency of intestinal calcium and phosphorous absorption from about -% to -% and % increased to %, respectively. Furthermore, calcitriol binds with vitamin D receptors in osteoblasts to stimulate a receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (or RANKL) which subsequently interacts with receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (NFkB) on immature preosteoclasts, causing them to become mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Such mature osteoclasts ultimately function in removing calcium and phosphorus from bone to maintain blood calcium and phosphorus levels. Moreover, calcitriol also stimulates calcium reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate in the kidneys.Additionally, it is believed that when calcitriol binds with nuclear vitamin D receptors, that this bound complex itself binds to retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to generate a heterodimeric complex that consequently binds to specific nucleotide sequences in the DNA called vitamin D response elements. When bound, various transcription factors attach to this complex, resulting in either up or down-regulation of the associated gene's activity. It is thought that there may be as much as  to  genes that possess vitamin D response elements or that are influenced indirectly to control a multitude of genes across the genome. It is in this way that cholecalciferol is believed to function in regulating gene transcription associated with cancer risk, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease linked to vitamin D deficiency. In fact, there has been some research to suggest calcitriol may also be able to prevent malignancies by inducing cellular maturation and inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting foam cell formation and promoting angiogenesis in endothelial colony-forming cells in vitro, inhibit immune reactions by enhancing the transcription of endogenous antibiotics like cathelicidin and regulate the activity and differentiation of CD+ T cells, amongst a variety of other proposed actions.TargetActionsOrganismAVitamin D receptoragonistHumans","['Calcium supplementation', 'Nutritional supplementation', 'Vitamin D Supplementation', 'Vitamin supplementation']","['Alimentary Tract and Metabolism', 'Bone Density Conservation Agents', 'Calcium-Regulating Hormones and Agents', 'Cholecalciferol, antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cholestanes', 'Cholestenes', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Diet, Food, and Nutrition', 'Drugs Affecting Bone Structure and Mineralization', 'Drugs for Treatment of Bone Diseases', 'Food', 'Fused-Ring Compounds', 'Growth Substances', 'Lipids', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Micronutrients', 'Musculo-Skeletal System', 'Physiological Phenomena', 'Secosteroids', 'Steroids', 'Sterols', 'Vitamin D and Analogues', 'Vitamins', 'Vitamins (Fat Soluble)']"

Slowing the reuptake of these neurotransmitters increases their concentration in the synaptic cleft, producing knock-on effects in protein kinase signalling which is thought to contribute to changes in neurotransmission and brain physiology which relieves symptoms of depression.TargetActionsOrganismASodium-dependent noradrenaline transporterinhibitorHumansASodium-dependent serotonin transporterinhibitorHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor AantagonistHumansNHistamine H receptorantagonistHumansNAlpha-A adrenergic receptorantagonistHumansNAlpha-D adrenergic receptorantagonistHumansNMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor MantagonistHumansNMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor MantagonistHumansNMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor MantagonistHumansNMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor MantagonistHumansNMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor MantagonistHumansNPotassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member inhibitorHumansNPotassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member inhibitorHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor CantagonistbinderHumansUAlpha-B adrenergic receptorantagonistHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonistHumansUD() dopamine receptorbinderHumansUDopamine D receptorbinderHumansUPotassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member inhibitorHumansUSodium-dependent dopamine transporterinhibitorHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor AactivatorHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor binderHumansUPotassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member Not AvailableHumansUAlpha--acid glycoprotein Not AvailableHumans",[],"['Adrenergic Agents', 'Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists', 'Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists', 'Adrenergic Antagonists', 'Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors', 'Agents producing tachycardia', 'Agents that produce hypertension', 'Agents that reduce seizure threshold', 'Anticholinergic Agents', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antidepressive Agents Indicated for Depression', 'Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Combined Inhibitors of Serotonin/Norepinephrine Reuptake', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C18 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C18 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors (strong)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Dibenzazepines', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Histamine Antagonists', 'Histamine H1 Antagonists', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'Membrane Transport Modulators', 'Moderate Risk QTc-Prolonging Agents', 'Muscarinic Antagonists', 'Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotoxic agents', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'Neurotransmitter Uptake Inhibitors', 'Non-Selective Monoamine Reuptake Inhibitors', 'OCT2 Inhibitors', 'P-glycoprotein substrates', 'P-glycoprotein substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Psychoanaleptics', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'QTc Prolonging Agents', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Antagonists', 'Serotonin 5-HT2A Receptor Antagonists', 'Serotonin 5-HT2C Receptor Antagonists', 'Serotonin Agents', 'Serotonin Modulators', 'Serotonin Receptor Antagonists', 'Tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressants', 'Tricyclics and Other Norepinephrine-reuptake Inhibitors']"

Patients with pre-existing impaired respiratory function are at increased risk of adverse effects including death during treatment with benzodiazepines. In addition, due to its CNS depressant effects, patients taking alprazolam should avoid operating heavy machinery or driving and should avoid other CNS depressants such as alcohol. As with other benzodiazepines, alprazolam carries a risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which is higher in predisposed individuals and may require strict monitoring. Cessation of therapy may result in acute or protracted withdrawal symptoms, which may be life-threatening; the patient dose should be gradually tapered whenever discontinuation or reduced dosage are necessary. Newborns born to mothers using alprazolam later in pregnancy may suffer from sedation and withdrawal symptoms. As CYP3A is required for the initial step in alprazolam metabolism, alprazolam is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole; milder CYP3A inhibitors still necessitate alprazolam dosage adjustments. Lastly, benzodiazepines may have negative effects, such as panic disorders, increased suicide incidence, and episodes of mania/hypomania, in patients suffering from depression.4,7,18,19",CC1=NN=C2CN=C(C3=CC=CC=C3)C3=C(C=CC(Cl)=C3)N12,"Neurotransmission relies on excitatory and inhibitory signalling. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors (GABAARs) are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (PLGIC) superfamily located synaptically and perisynaptically to mediate phasic inhibition and extrasynaptically to mediate tonic inhibition. GABAARs comprise a variety of subunits from a homologous family whose members are named based on sequence identity as one of α-, β-, γ-, δ, ε, θ, π, and ρ-. Each subunit possesses an extracellular (ECD), transmembrane (TMD), and intracellular (ICD) domain; inter-subunit interfaces are the primary points of neurotransmitter and modulator binding, described by coordination of the principal (+) and complementary (-) sites in each subunit. Binding of GABA to GABAARs induces pore opening, rapid flow of chloride ions, and synaptic hyperpolarization, which in turn manifests as an inhibitory signal.,The most prevalent GABAARsin vivoare the αβγ receptors, which contain both GABA (β+/α-) and benzodiazepine (BZD, α+/γ-) binding sites in the intersubunit interfaces of the relevant subunits.,,In general, any receptors containing an αx/γzinterface, where x = -, and z = -, have potential high-affinity BZD binding sites, although small sequence differences between subunits may alter binding affinity to individual molecules. The α and α subunits, in which an otherwise conserved histidine is replaced by arginine, do not bind traditional BZD ligands such as diazepam and hence are considered ""diazepam-insensitive"".,,GABA binding results in a series of conformational changes in the ECDs of GABAAR β subunits, ""locking"" each to its neighbouring α- interface. The binding of alprazolam in the high-affinity BZD site stabilizes the α+/γ- interface and facilitates the conformational changes that lead to pore opening, hence functioning as a positive allosteric modulator.The exact manner in which GABAAR allosteric modulation mediates the therapeutic and unwanted effects of benzodiazepines remains unclear.,Earlier studies suggested that the primary factor was the α subunit composition, with α-containing receptors mediating the sedative effects, α/-containing receptors the anxiolytic effects, and α-containing receptors the memory effects of benzodiazepines.More recent studies suggest a more complex set of factors including subunit composition, physiological location, neuronal circuit, and nerve cell type.To further complicate matters, there may be up to five distinct BZD binding sites on GABAARs, with site  corresponding to the classical high-affinity α+/γ- interface.

Compared toscopolamine, atropine has a more potent and prolonged effect on the heart, intestine and bronchial muscle, but a weaker effect on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands. Atropine leads to increased respiratory rate and depth of respiration, possibly due to the drug-induced bronchiolar dilatation rather than its mild effect on vagal excitation.8At an adequate dose, atropine abolishes different types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. Atropine can be used to prevent or abolish bradycardia or asystole induced by the injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus.8When vagal activity is an etiologic factor, atropine may also lessen the degree of partial heart block. In clinical doses, atropine counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure.8The use of topical atropine in the eye induces mydriasis by inhibiting the contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle normally stimulated by acetylcholine. This results in the contraction of the countering radial pupillary dilator muscle and pupil dilation.7The use of atropine may precipitate acute glaucoma and convert partial organic pyloric stenosis into complete obstruction.

Baclofen is an agonist at the beta subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors expressed on pre- and post-synaptic neurons.Upon binding to GABABreceptors, baclofen causes an influx of potassium into the neuron, leading to hyperpolarization of the neuronal membrane and decreased calcium influx at presynaptic nerve terminals. This results in a decreased rate of action potential threshold being reached by presynaptic neurons and reduced action potential of postsynaptic motor neurons that innervate the muscle spindles. Baclofen thereby inhibits the transmission of both mono- and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal cord, relaxing spasticity.Baclofen may act on some voltage-gated calcium channels; however, the clinical significance of this is unclear.TargetActionsOrganismAGamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit agonistHumansUC-X-C chemokine receptor type allosteric modulatorHumansUGamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit agonistHumans",[],"['Agents Causing Muscle Toxicity', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins', 'Aminobutyrates', 'Butyrates', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'GABA Agents', 'GABA Agonists', 'GABA-B Receptor Agonists', 'Gaba-derivative Skeletal Muscle Relaxants', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid-ergic Agonist', 'Muscle Relaxants', 'Muscle Relaxants, Centrally Acting Agents', 'Muscle Relaxants, Peripherally Acting Agents', 'Musculo-Skeletal System', 'Neurotransmitter Agents']"

Its main sites of action are the intestine, bone, kidney and parathyroid hormoneLabel. Calcitriol is a ligand for the vitamin D nuclear receptor, which is expressed in, but not limited to, gastrointestinal (GI) tissues, bones, and kidneys1. As an active form of vitamin D3, calcitriol elevates the plasma levels of calcium by stimulating intestinal calcium uptake, increasing reabsorption of calcium by the kidneys, and possibly increasing the release of calcium from skeletal stores. The duration of pharmacologic activity of a single dose of exogenous calcitriol is expected to be about 3 to 5 daysLabel.In addition to its important role in calcium metabolism, other pharmacological effects of calcitriol have been studied in various conditions including cancer models. Various studies demonstrated expression of vitamin D receptors in cancer cell lines, including mouse myeloid leukemia cells1. Calcitriol has been found to induce differentiation and/or inhibit cell proliferationin vitroandin vivoin many cell types, such as malignant cell lines carcinomas of the breast, prostate, colon, skin, and brain, myeloid leukemia cells, and others2. In early human prostate cancer trials, administration of 1.5 µg/d calcitriol in male participants resulted in a reduction in the rate of PSA rise in most participants, however it was coincided with dose-limiting hypercalcemia in most participants1. Hypercalcemia and hypercalcuria were evident in numerous initial trials, and this may be due to these trials not testing the drug at concentrations that are active in preclinical systems2. Findings from preclinical data show an additive or synergistic antineoplastic action of calcitriol when combined with agents including dexamethasone, retinoids, and radiation, as well as several cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs such as platinum compounds2.Vitamin D deficiency has long been suspected to increase the susceptibility to tuberculosis. The active form of calcitriol, 1,25-(OH)2-D3, has been found to enhance the ability of mononuclear phagocytes to suppress the intracellular growth ofMycobacterium tuberculosis. 1,25-(OH)2-D3 has demonstrated beneficial effects in animal models of such autoimmune diseases as rheumatoid arthritis. Vitamin D appears to demonstrate both immune-enhancing and immunosuppressive effects.",C[C@H](CCCC(C)(C)O)[C@@]1([H])CC[C@@]2([H])\C(CCC[C@]12C)=C\C=C1\C[C@@H](O)C[C@H](O)C1=C,"The mechanism of action of calcitriol in the treatment of psoriasis is accounted for by their antiproliferative activity for keratinocytes and their stimulation of epidermal cell differentiation. The anticarcinogenic activity of the active form of Calcitriol appears to be correlated with cellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) levels. Vitamin D receptors belong to the superfamily of steroid-hormone zinc-finger receptors. VDRs selectively bind ,-(OH)-D and retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to form a heterodimeric complex that interacts with specific DNA sequences known as vitamin D-responsive elements. VDRs are ligand-activated transcription factors. The receptors activate or repress the transcription of target genes upon binding their respective ligands. It is thought that the anticarcinogenic effect of Calcitriol is mediated via VDRs in cancer cells. The immunomodulatory activity of calcitriol is thought to be mediated by vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are expressed constitutively in monocytes but induced upon activation of T and B lymphocytes. ,-(OH)-D has also been found to enhance the activity of some vitamin D-receptor positive immune cells and to enhance the sensitivity of certain target cells to various cytokines secreted by immune cells.A study suggests that calcitriol plays an immunoregulatry role by suppressing the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression in human Th, a pro-inflammatory CD T cell subset. This suppression subsequently leads to repressed expression of BATF, a transcription factor essential for Th. Calcitriol has also been found to induce monocyte differentiation and to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and production of cytokines, including interleukin IL- and IL-, as well as to suppress immunoglobulin secretion by B lymphocytes.TargetActionsOrganismAVitamin D receptoragonistHumansUHomeobox protein Hox-ANot AvailableHumans",[],"['Alimentary Tract and Metabolism', 'Antipsoriatics', 'Antipsoriatics for Topical Use', 'Bone Density Conservation Agents', 'Calcium-Regulating Hormones and Agents', 'Cholestanes', 'Cholestenes', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Diet, Food, and Nutrition', 'Food', 'Fused-Ring Compounds', 'Growth Substances', 'Lipids', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Membrane Transport Modulators', 'Micronutrients', 'Misc.

DB00177,Valsartan,Valsartanis an angiotensin-receptor blocker used to manage hypertension alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents and to manage heart failure in patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors.,['P30556'],"Valsartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II with oral doses of 80 mg inhibiting the pressor effect by about 80% at peak with approximately 30% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a 2- to 3-fold rise in plasma renin and consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients. Minimal decreases in plasma aldosterone were observed after administration of valsartan.In multiple-dose studies in hypertensive patients, valsartan had no notable effects on total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, fasting serum glucose, or uric acid.18HypotensionExcessive hypotension was rarely seen (0.1%) in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with valsartan alone. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur. This condition should be corrected prior to administration of valsartan, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision.Caution should be observed when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure. Patients with heart failure given valsartan commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, but discontinuation of therapy because of continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed. In controlled trials in heart failure patients, the incidence of hypotension in valsartan-treated patients was 5.5% compared to 1.8% in placebo-treated patients.If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.18Impaired Renal FunctionChanges in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on valsartan. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on valsartan.18HyperkalemiaSome patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium. These effects are usually minor and transient, and they are more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of valsartan may be required.18",CCCCC(=O)N(CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1C1=NNN=N1)[C@@H](C(C)C)C(O)=O,"Valsartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which selectively bind to angiotensin receptor  (AT) and prevent angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects. These include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium among others. Overall, valsartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium.Valsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via AT receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and prevent ventricular hypertrophy.The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such asramipril,lisinopril, andperindopril) inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by inhibiting the ACE enzyme but does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II. ARB activity is unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized.Valsartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and type  diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as valsartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.,,,,,,,Valsartan also slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.,,Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type  diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.,Valsartan also binds to the AT receptor, however AT is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis like AT. Valsartan has about ,-fold higher affinity for the AT receptor than for the AT receptor.

It causes sustained dilation of both the arterial resistance and conductive vessels that increases coronary blood flow, however the effect of the drug on coronary arteries does not involve the coronary steal phenomenon12. Activation of potassium channels lead to hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle cells, followed by arterial dilation and afterload reduction. Nicorandil is shown to increase pooling in the capacitance vessels with a decrease in preload through relaxing the venous vascular system. Overall, improved blood flow and reduced infarct size are achieved through reduction of end-diastolix pressure and decreased extravascular component of vascular resistance12. Open studies showed the effectiveness of nicorandil treatment on various types of angina pectoris8.",[O-][N+](=O)OCCNC(=O)C1=CC=CN=C1,"Nicorandil mediates its therapeutic efficacy via two main mechanisms. Nicorandil is an activator and opener of ATP-sensitive (ATP-dependent) potassium channels (KATP channels) that are composed of Kir.x-type subunits and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. Nicorandil binding sites are located in the sulfonylurea receptor  (SUR) in the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, which are regulatory subunits of the channel that exhibit an ATPase activitiy. There are  types of SUR subunits (A/B) that have identical nucleotide binding domains (NBD), where SURA is more predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac myocytes and SURB in smooth muscle cells. Nicorandil more potently activates SURB/Kir. than SURA/Kir. channels to cause hyperpolarization. ATP-NBD interaction influences the channel signalling by nicorandil, and the response of the channel to nicorandil is also facilitated and heightened by the interaction of ATP or ADP with NBD. Potentiated activity of ATP-sensitive channels have cardioprotective role by limiting the duration of action potentials and preventing intraceullar calcium overload. This attenuates cellular injury by preserving cellular energetics and ultimately cell survival. KATP channel-dependent membrane hyperpolarization can also lead to vasodilation via reduction in Ca+ influx through the voltage-gated Ca+ channels and regulation of intracellular Ca+ mobilization in smooth muscle cells.
Nicorandil contain a nitrate moiety in its structure, making it a good dilator of vascular smooth muscle like other nitroglycerin esters. Direct relaxation of venous vascular system arises from NO-donor mediated stimulation of guanylyl cyclase and increased levels of intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP). Elevated levels of cGMP contributes to the total relaxing effect of nicorandil at higher concentrations of the drug.TargetActionsOrganismAATP-binding cassette sub-family C member activatorHumans",[],"['Agents causing hyperkalemia', 'Antiarrhythmic agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Cardiac Therapy', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Micronutrients', 'Nicotinic Acids', 'Nitrates', 'Potassium Channel Opener', 'Pyridines', 'Vasodilating Agents', 'Vasodilators Used in Cardiac Diseases']"

Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland.

It has the highest affinity for the AT1receptor among commercially available ARBs and has minimal affinity for the AT2receptor.5New studies suggest that telmisartan may also have PPARγ agonistic properties that could potentially confer beneficial metabolic effects, as PPARγ is a nuclear receptor that regulates specific gene transcription, and whose target genes are involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as anti-inflammatory responses. This observation is currently being explored in clinical trials.3Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan works by blocking the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secretory effects of angiotensin II.2,5",CCCC1=NC2=C(C=C(C=C2C)C2=NC3=CC=CC=C3N2C)N1CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1C(O)=O,"Telmisartan interferes with the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II AT-receptor by binding reversibly and selectively to the receptors in vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland.

Telmisartan does not inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme, other hormone receptors, or ion channels.Studies also suggest that telmisartan is a partial agonist of PPARγ, which is an established target for antidiabetic drugs. This suggests that telmisartan can improve carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as well as control insulin resistance without causing the side effects that are associated with full PPARγ activators.TargetActionsOrganismAPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gammapartial agonistHumansAType- angiotensin II receptorantagonistHumans",[],"['Agents Acting on the Renin-Angiotensin System', 'Agents causing angioedema', 'Agents causing hyperkalemia', 'Angiotensin 2 Receptor Blocker', 'Angiotensin II receptor antagonists', 'Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium channel blockers', 'Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and diuretics', 'Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), plain', 'Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers', 'Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor Blockers', 'Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents Indicated for Hypertension', 'BCRP/ABCG2 Inhibitors', 'Benzene Derivatives', 'Benzimidazoles', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'UGT1A3 substrates']"

Because inhibition of T-type calcium channels in the sinoatrial (SA node) node attenuate reflex tachycardia, this drug favorably affects cardiac pacing.

Efonidipine exerts negative chronotropic effects, decreasing heart rate. Acting on SA node cells by inhibiting T-type calcium channel activity, Efonidipine prolongs the late phase- depolarization of the sinoatrial node action potential, decreasing heart rate. This is associated with decreased myocardial oxygen demand and increases of blood flow to the coronary arteries and thereby attenuates myocardial ischemia. Efonidipine increases glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without increasing intra-glomerular pressure and filtration fraction,,. This increase leads to the prevention of renal damage that is normally associated with hypertension.Efonidipine increases the rate of renal sodium excretion via the suppression of aldosterone synthesis and aldosterone secretion from the adrenal glands. Aldosterone-induced renal parenchymal fibrosis is said to be suppressed by efonidipine.L-type calcium channel blockers, such as efonidipine, preferentially dilate afferent arterioles in the kidney, whereas both L-/T-type and L-/N-type calcium channel blockers potently dilate both afferent and efferent arterioles. The distinct actions of calcium channel blockers on the renal microcirculation are demonstrated by changes in glomerular capillary pressure and subsequent renal injury: L-type calcium channel blockers favor an increase in glomerular capillary pressure, whereas L-/T-type and L-/N-type CCBs alleviate glomerular hypertension. This supports the theory that L-Type/T-type calcium channel blockers may be of benefit in renal hypertension. Efonidipine is a long-acting medication due to a low dissociation constant.Recent studies suggest that efonidipine reduces plasma aldosterone levels in patients on regular hemodialysis, which is of additional benefit to the cardiovascular protection by antihypertensive therapy with efonidipine in patients with end-stage renal disease.TargetActionsOrganismUVoltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-IantagonistHumansUVoltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit alpha-CNot AvailableHumansAVoltage gated L-type calcium channelblockerHumansAVoltage-dependent calcium channelinhibitorHumansAVoltage-dependent T-type calcium channelinhibitorHumansAVoltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-GinhibitorHumansAVoltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-HinhibitorHumans",[],"['Agents causing hyperkalemia', 'Antiarrhythmic agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Benzene Derivatives', 'Bradycardia-Causing Agents', 'Calcium Channel Blockers', 'Calcium-Regulating Hormones and Agents', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Diuretics', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'Membrane Transport Modulators', 'Natriuretic Agents', 'Nitro Compounds', 'Phenols', 'Potential QTc-Prolonging Agents', 'Pyridines', 'QTc Prolonging Agents', 'Vasodilating Agents']"

The first dose of doxazosin may lead to such effects, however, subsequent doses may also cause them. The risk of these effects is particularly high when dose adjustments occur or there are long intervals between doxazosin doses.

In PAD patients with concurrent cerebrovascular and coronary artery diseases, pentoxifylline treatment has occasionally been associated with angina, arrhythmia, and hypotension. Concurrent use withwarfarinshould be associated with more frequent monitoring of prothrombin times. Also, patients with risk factors complicated by hemorrhages, such as retinal bleeding, peptic ulceration, and recent surgery, should be monitored periodically for bleeding signs.29",CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(CCCCC(C)=O)C(=O)N2C,"Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) may suffer from intermittent claudication, exertional leg pain that resolves upon rest, which is underscored by a complex etiology including vascular dysfunction (reduced limb perfusion, angiogenesis, and microcirculatory flow), systemic inflammation, and skeletal muscle dysfunction.Pentoxifylline (PTX), (,-dimethyl--(-oxohexyl)-,-dihydro-H-purine-,-dione) or -(-oxohexyl)-,-­dimethylxanthine, is a methyl-xanthine derivative that acts to lower blood viscosity by increasing erythrocyte flexibility, reducing plasma fibrinogen, inhibiting neutrophil activation, and suppressing erythrocyte/platelet aggregation; it also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.,Although the precise mechanism of action has yet to be elucidated, numerous studies have suggested several effects of PTX.The classical interpretation of PTX's broad effects is due to its ability to act,in vitro, as a non-specific cyclic-','-phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor at millimolar concentrations; specifically, it has been proposed that inhibition of PDE type III and IV isozymes leads to elevated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which mediate diverse downstream effects.,,This view has been challenged, specifically by observing those plasma concentrations of PTX in routine clinical use are typically only around μM, far lower than those used to inhibit PDEsin vitro.Instead, several studies have suggested that PTX can modulate adenosine receptor function, specifically the Gα-coupled AA receptor (AAR). Whether PTX acts directly as an AAR agonist is unclear, although it can clearly increase the response of AAR to adenosine.,,,AAR activation activates adenylyl cyclase, which increases intracellular cAMP levels; this observation may explain PTX's ability to increase intracellular cAMP in a PDE-independent fashion.Elevated cAMP levels have numerous downstream effects. cAMP-mediated activation of protein kinase A (PKA) suppresses nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which suppresses transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin- (IL-), and IL- as well as TNF-induced molecules such as adhesion molecules (ICAM and VCAM) and the C-reactive protein (CRP).,,,PTX has also been shown to prevent the downstream phosphorylation of p MAPK and ERK, which are responsible for assembling the NADPH oxidase involved in the neutrophil oxidative burst. This effect is due to a PKA-independent decrease in Akt phosphorylation and a PKA-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of p MAPK and ERK.,,This transcriptional regulation at least partially explains the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of PTX.Also, activated PKA can activate the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which itself blocks SMAD-driven gene transcription, effectively disrupting transforming growth factor (TGF-β) signalling.,This results in lower levels of fibrinogenic molecules such as collagens, fibronectin, connective tissue growth factor, and alpha-smooth muscle actin.,,,Hence, disruption of TGF-β signalling may explain the anti-fibrotic effects of PTX, including at least some of the decrease in blood viscosity.The picture is complicated by the observation that PTX metabolites M, M, and M have been shown to inhibit C Des Arg- and formyl-methionylleucylphenylalanine-induced superoxide production in neutrophils and M and M significantly contribute to PTX's observed hemorheological effects.,,Overall, PTX administration is associated with decreased pro-inflammatory molecules, an increase in anti-inflammatory molecules such as IL-, and decreased production of fibrinogenic and cellular adhesion molecules.TargetActionsOrganismAAdenosine receptor AaagonistHumansAPhosphodiesterase enzymesinhibitorHumansUAdenosine receptor ANot AvailableHumansU'-nucleotidaseinhibitorHumans",[],"['Alkaloids', 'Antioxidants', 'Antiplatelet agents', 'Blood Viscosity Reducer', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Compounds used in a research, industrial, or household setting', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs for Obstructive Airway Diseases', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Hematologic Activity Alteration', 'Hematologic Agents', 'Hemorrheologic Agents', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Peripheral Vasodilators', 'Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors', 'Protective Agents', 'Purine Derivatives', 'Purines', 'Purinones', 'Radiation-Protective Agents', 'Vasodilating Agents', 'Xanthine derivatives']"

Initiate treatment under close medical supervision. If hypotension does occur, place the patient in the supine position and, if necessary, give an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.23,24Valvular Stenosis: there is concern on theoretical grounds that patients with aortic stenosis might be at a particular risk of decreased coronary perfusion, because they do not develop as much afterload reduction.24Impaired Renal FunctionAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with olmesartan. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with olmesartan.In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been reported. There has been no long-term use of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar results may be expected.23,24Sprue-like EnteropathySevere, chronic diarrhea with substantial weight loss has been reported in patients taking olmesartan months to years after drug initiation.

ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor  (AT) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects. As the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT receptor in vascular smooth muscle. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.Overall, olmesartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium.Olmesartan also effects on the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via AT receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.TargetActionsOrganismAType- angiotensin II receptorantagonistHumans",[],"['Agents Acting on the Renin-Angiotensin System', 'Agents causing hyperkalemia', 'Angiotensin 2 Receptor Blocker', 'Angiotensin II Antagonists and Calcium Channel Blockers', 'Angiotensin II receptor antagonists', 'Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium channel blockers', 'Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and diuretics', 'Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), plain', 'Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Antihypertensive Agents Indicated for Hypertension', 'BSEP/ABCB11 Inhibitors', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'Imidazoles', 'OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Substrates', 'OATP1B3 substrates', 'Tetrazoles']"

Opioid receptors are involved in various brain signalling pathways, including the mesolimbic pathway, sometimes referred to as the reward pathway. The mesolimbic pathway plays an important role in the positive reinforcement of natural rewards like food and drugs of abuse like exogenous opioid drugs. Many abused drugs activate mu-opioid receptors, leading to positive reinforcing effects.Alcohol consumption can also cause the release of endogenous opioids, which bind to mu and delta receptors, thereby increasing the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens to induce reward and positive reinforcement effects.Nalmefene is an antagonist at the mu and delta-opioid receptors and a partial agonist at the kappa-opioid receptor. As an antagonist, nalmefene blocks ligands from binding to the opioid receptor.Animal studies suggest that kappa-opioid receptor signalling blocks acute reward and positive reinforcement effects of drugs with abusive potential by decreasing dopamine in the nucleus accumbens.In vivostudies have demonstrated that nalmefene reduces alcohol consumption, possibly by modulating cortico-mesolimbic functions.Preclinical studies suggest that nalmefene restores alcohol-induced dysregulations of the MOR/endorphins and the KOR/dynorphin system.TargetActionsOrganismAKappa-type opioid receptorpartial agonistHumansADelta-type opioid receptorantagonistHumansAMu-type opioid receptorantagonistHumans",[],"['Alkaloids', 'Antidotes', 'Antipruritics', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Drugs Used in Addictive Disorders', 'Drugs Used in Alcohol Dependence', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Morphinans', 'Nervous System', 'Opiate Alkaloids', 'Opioid Antagonists', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Phenanthrenes', 'Sensory System Agents', 'UGT1A3 substrates', 'UGT2B7 substrates']"

The maximum effect of a rapid reduction in serum DHT concentration is expected to be observed 8 hours following administration of the first dose.13In a single man receiving a single oral dose of 5 mg finasteride for up to 4 years, there was a reduction in the serum DHT concentrations by approximately 70% and the median circulating level of testosterone increased by approximately 10-20% within the physiologic range.13In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, finasteride reduced intraprostatic DHT level by 91.4% but finasteride is not expected to decrease the DHT levels to castrate levels since circulating testosterone is also converted to DHT by the type 1 isoenzyme expressed in other tissues.1It is expected that DHT levels return to normal within 14 days upon discontinuation of the drug.12In a study of male patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia prior to prostatectomy, the treatment with finasteride resulted in an approximate 80% lower DHT content was measured in prostatic tissue removed at surgery compared to placebo.13While finasteride reduces the size of the prostate gland by 20%, this may not correlate well with improvement in symptoms.8The effects of finasteride are reported to be more pronounced in male patients with enlarged prostates (>25 mL) who are at the greatest risk of disease progression.1In phase III clinical studies, oral administration of finasteride in male patients with male pattern hair loss promoted hair growth and prevented further hair loss by 66% and 83% of the subjects, respectively, which lasted during two years' treatment.6The incidences of these effects in treatment groups were significantly higher than that of the group receiving a placebo.6Following finasteride administration, the levels of DHT in the scalp skin was shown to be reduced by more than 60%, indicating that the DHT found in scalp is derived from both local DHT production and circulating DHT.5The effect of finasteride on scalp DHT is likely seen because of its effect on both local follicular DHT levels as well as serum DHT levels.5.

It serves as the hormonal mediator for the hyperplasia upon accumulation within the prostate gland.DHT displays a higher affinity towards androgen receptors in the prostate gland compared to testosteroneand by acting on the androgen receptors, DHT modulates genes that are responsible for cell proliferation.Responsible for the production of DHT together with type I α-reductase, the type II α-reductase isozyme is primarily found in the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymides, and hair follicles as well as liver.Although finasteride is -fold more selective for type II α-reductase than for the type I isoenzyme,chronic treatment with this drug may have some effect on type I α-reductase, which is predominantly expressed in sebaceous glands of most regions of skin, including the scalp, and liver. It is proposed that the type I α-reductase and type II α-reductase is responsible for the production of one-third and two-thirds of circulating DHT, respectively.The mechanism of action of Finasteride is based on its preferential inhibition of Type II α-reductase through the formation of a stable complex with the enzymein vitroandin vivo.Finasteride works selectively, where it preferentially displays a -fold selectivity for the human Type II α-reductase over type I enzyme.Inhibition of Type II α-reductase blocks the peripheral conversion of testosterone to DHT, resulting in significant decreases in serum and tissue DHT concentrations, minimal to moderate increase in serum testosterone concentrations, and substantial increases in prostatic testosterone concentrations. As DHT appears to be the principal androgen responsible for stimulation of prostatic growth, a decrease in DHT concentrations will result in a decrease in prostatic volume (approximately -% after - months of continued therapy). It is suggested that increased levels of DHT can lead to potentiated transcription of prostaglandin D, which promotes the proliferation of prostate cancer cells.In men with androgenic alopecia, the mechanism of action has not been fully determined, but finasteride has shown to decrease scalp DHT concentration to the levels found in the hairy scalp, reduce serum DHT, increase hair regrowth, and slow hair loss. Another study suggests that finasteride may work to reduce bleeding of prostatic origin by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the prostate, leading to atrophy and programmed cell death.This may bestow the drug therapeutic benefits in patients idiopathic prostatic bleeding, bleeding during anticoagulation, or bleeding after instrumentation.TargetActionsOrganismA-oxo--alpha-steroid -dehydrogenase inhibitorHumansU-oxo--alpha-steroid -dehydrogenase inhibitorHumansU-oxo--beta-steroid -dehydrogenaseinhibitorHumans",[],"['5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors', 'Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists', 'Adrenergic Antagonists', 'Agents that produce hypertension', 'Androstanes', 'Androstenes', 'Azasteroids', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Dermatologicals', 'Drugs Used in Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Fused-Ring Compounds', 'Genito Urinary System and Sex Hormones', 'Genitourinary Agents', 'Hormone Antagonists', 'Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists', 'Misc.

Studies show that acetylcholine (ACh) is involved in the modulation of acquisition, encoding, consolidation, reconsolidation, extinction, and retrieval of memory. The gradual loss of cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may, therefore, contribute to the memory loss exhibited by AD patients.Acetylcholinesterase is secreted by cholinergic neurons to rapidly hydrolyze ACh at the synaptic cleft to release acetate and choline. Choline is later recycled back into the presynaptic cholinergic neuron via reuptake by the high-affinity choline transporter. There is some evidence demonstrating the potential involvement of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme in the formation of amyloid fibrils.Galantamine competitively and reversibly inhibits the anticholinesterase enzyme in the CNS (namely in the frontal cortex and hippocampal regions)by binding to the choline-binding site and acyl-binding pocket of the enzyme active site.By blocking the breakdown of ACh, galantamine enhances ACh levels in the synaptic cleft.Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in the CNS are mostly expressed at the presynaptic neuronal membrane to control the release of multiple neurotransmitters, such as ACh, glutamate, GABA, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine.,Agonists of nAChRs improve performance in cognitive tasks, while antagonists of nAChR impair cognitive processes.Some studies show a decrease in the expression and activity of nAChRs in patients with AD, which may explain the reduction in central cholinergic neurotransmission in these patients.Galantamine binds to nAChRs at the allosteric site,,leading to a conformational change of the receptor, increased ACh release, and increased activity of neighbouring glutaminergic and serotoninergic neurons.The modulation of nAChRs facilitates both excitatory and inhibitory cholinergic transmissions in brain tissues and increases receptor sensitivity. The modulated release of other neurotransmitters by galantamine may also contribute to the upregulation of nAChRs and amelioration of behavioural symptoms in AD.TargetActionsOrganismAAcetylcholinesteraseinhibitorHumansANeuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-allosteric modulatorHumansUMuscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptorallosteric modulatorHumansUCholinesteraseinhibitorHumans",[],"['Alkaloids', 'Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids', 'Anti-Dementia Drugs', 'Autonomic Agents', 'Benzazepines', 'Bradycardia-Causing Agents', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Cholinergic Agents', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'Nootropic Agents', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'Parasympathomemetic (Cholinergic) Agents', 'Parasympathomimetics', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Potential QTc-Prolonging Agents', 'Psychoanaleptics', 'QTc Prolonging Agents']"

In humans, COMT is distributed throughout various organs. COMT catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the phenolic group of substrates that contain a catechol structure. Physiological substrates of COMT include dopa, catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) and their hydroxylated metabolites. The function of COMT is the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. COMT is responsible for the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. In the presence of a decarboxylase inhibitor, COMT becomes the major metabolizing enzyme for levodopa catalyzing it to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine (3-OMD) in the brain and periphery. When tolcapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone. It is believed that these sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease in patients as well as increased levodopa adverse effects, sometimes requiring a decrease in the dose of levodopa.",CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)C1=CC(=C(O)C(O)=C1)[N+]([O-])=O,"The precise mechanism of action of tolcapone is unknown, but it is believed to be related to its ability to inhibit COMT and alter the plasma pharmacokinetics of levodopa, resulting in an increase in plasma levodopa concentrations.

This may lead to an increase distribution of levodopa into the CNS through the reduction of its competitive substrate, -OMD, for transport mechanisms.

Amisulpride is an atypical antipsychotic agent that works as an antagonist at dopamine receptors in the limbic system. Since it works preferentially in the limbic system, amisulpride is less likely to be associated with extrapyramidal adverse effects than other atypical antipsychotic agents. Amisulpride has no affinity for serotonin, alpha-adrenergic, H1-histamine, cholinergic, and sigma receptors. In clinical trials, amisulpride improved reduced secondary negative symptoms, affective symptoms, and psychomotor retardation in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Notably, amisulpride has a differential target binding profile at different doses: at low doses, amisulpride selectively binds to presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors. At high doses, it preferentially binds to post-synaptic dopamine receptors.3This explains how amisulpride reduces negative symptoms at low doses and mediates antipsychotic effects at high doses.11One study alluded that the antinociceptive effects of amisulpride are mediated through opioid receptor acvitation and D2 receptor antagonism.3,5The actions of amisulpride at opioid receptors may explain its pro-convulsant properties.5Amisulpride is also an antiemetic agent that prevents and alleviates postoperative nausea and vomiting. It primarily works by blocking dopamine signalling in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, which is a brain area that relays stimuli to the vomiting center.11In clinical trials comprising Caucasian and Japanese subjects, amisulpride caused dose- and concentration-dependent prolongation of the QT interval; thus, intravenous infusion under a strict dosing regimen and close monitoring of patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions are recommended.10Amisulpride increases plasma prolactin levels, leading to an association with benign pituitary tumours such as prolactinoma.11",CCN1CCCC1CNC(=O)C1=CC(=C(N)C=C1OC)S(=O)(=O)CC,"Dopamine is an essential and critical neurotransmitter produced in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental regions of the brain.

CTZ is involved in emesis: it contains receptors, such as dopamine receptors, that are activated in response to emetic agents in the blood and relay information to the vomiting center, which is responsible for inducing the vomiting reflex.Amisulpride is an antiemetic agent that works to limit signals that promote nausea and vomiting.

Temazepam produces CNS depression at limbic, thalamic, and hypothalamic levels of the CNS6,7,13,14. Temazepam increases the affinity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) for GABA receptors by binding to benzodiazepine receptors6,7,13,14. Results are sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action6,7,13,14.In sleep laboratory studies, the effect of temazepam was compared to placebo during a two week period13. The studies demonstrated a linear dose-response improvement in total sleep time and sleep latency with substantial drug-placebo differences apparent for total sleep time and for sleep latency at higher doses of temazepam13. Regardless, REM sleep was ultimately unchanged but slow wave sleep was decreased13.Moreover, a transient syndrome, known as ""rebound insomnia"", wherein the symptoms that led to treatment with temazepam in the first place recur in an enhanced form, may happen on withdrawal of temazepam treatment13. The possibility of this occurrence is in part why long term use of temazepam is not recommended due to worries over tolerance and dependence wherein patients' bodies become physiologically accustomed to the regular presence and pharmacological effect of higher and higher doses of the benzodiazepine used13.The duration of hypnotic effect and the profile of unwanted adverse effects may be influenced by the distribution and elimination half-lives of the administered temazepam and any active metabolites that may be formed13. When such half-lives are long, the drug or its metabolite(s) may accumulate during periods of nightly administration and be associated with impairments of cognitive and motor performance during waking hours13. Conversely, if half-lives are short, the drug and metabolites would be cleared before the next dose is ingested, and carry-over effects related to sedation or CNS depression should be minimal or not present at all13. However, during nightly use and for an extended period, pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics may develop - which may also contribute to the possibility of 'rebound insomnia'13.Consequently, if the drug has a very short elimination half-life, it is possible that a relative deficiency (for example, in relation to benzodiazepine GABA(a) receptor sites) may occur at some point in the interval between each night's use13. This sequence of events may account for certain clinical findings reported happening after several weeks of nightly use of rapidly eliminated benzodiazepine hypnotics, including increased wakefulness during the last third of the night and the appearance of increased daytime anxiety13.",CN1C2=C(C=C(Cl)C=C2)C(=NC(O)C1=O)C1=CC=CC=C1,"Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is considered the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human body,,,.

This binding acts to enhance the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA(a) receptor, which ultimately enhances GABA ligand binding at the receptors,,,. This enhanced ligand binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the receptors increases the aforementioned chloride ion conduction (perhaps reportedly via an increase in the frequency of the chloride channel opening), resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the associated neuron cells,,,.

Due to the above effects, the FDA has recommended an initial dose of zolpidem (immediate-acting) is a single dose of 5 mg for women and a single dose of 5 or 10 mg for men, immediately before bedtime with at least 7-8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening14. Refer to product labeling for detailed information18,Label.Effects on memoryControlled studies in adults using objective measures of memory demonstrated no significant evidence of next-day memory impairment after the administration of zolpidem. On the contrary, in a clinical study involving the administration of zolpidem doses of 10 and 20 mg, a marked reduction in a next-morning recall of information relayed to subjects during peak drug effect (90 minutes after dosing) was observed. These subjects experienced a condition known asanterograde amnesia. Subjective evidence from adverse event data has suggested that anterograde amnesia may occur after zolpidem administration, mainly at doses above 10 mgLabel.Effects on psychomotor functionThis drug may cause decreased psychomotor performance. Additive psychomotor effects may occur with other drugs that cause depression of psychomotor function, including alcoholLabel. Patients taking zolpidem should be cautioned against participating in hazardous activities or occupations requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination, including operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after ingesting the drug. Potential impairment of the performance of the above types of activities may also occur the day after zolpidem ingestion, especially at higher doses and ingestion of the extended-release formLabel,18.Effects on insomnia and sleep stagesEvidence suggests that this drug is associated with minimal rebound insomnia. During clinical trials with patients using zolpidem on an ‘as-needed’ basis, zolpidem use resulted in global improvements in sleep6. Zolpidem has been demonstrated to decrease sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) for up to 35 days in controlled clinical studiesLabel. In studies measuring the percentage of sleep time spent in each sleep stage, zolpidem has primarily been shown to preserve sleep stages. Sleep time spent in stages 3 and 4 (deep sleep) was measured as similar to placebo with only minor and inconsistent changes in REM (paradoxical) sleep at the recommended doseLabel.Next-day residual effectsIn 2013, the FDA issued a statement warning that patients who take zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR)―either 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg―should not drive or participate in other activities requiring full mental alertness the day after taking the drug, due to the fact that zolpidem concentrations can remain increased the next day, and impair the ability to perform these activities14,18. Patients may decrease their risk of next-morning impairment by taking the lowest dose of their insomnia medicine that treats their symptoms, according to the FDA16. Specific dosing recommendations for both men and women are included in this statement14. This information is also available on product labeling18,Label.Rebound effectsThere was no polysomnographic (objective) evidence of rebound insomnia at normal doses, in studies evaluating sleep on the nights following discontinuation of zolpidem tartrate.

The main regulatory site of the GABAA receptor complex can be found on itsalpha (α) subunitand is called thebenzodiazepine(BZ) oromega (ω)receptor. At least three different subtypes of the (ω) receptor have been identified to this dateLabel.In contrast to benzodiazepine drugs, which are found to modulate all benzodiazepine receptor subtypes in a non-selective fashion, zolpidem binds the (BZ) receptor specifically with a potent affinity for the alpha /alpha  subunits (in vitro)Label. More recent studies suggest that zolpidem binds primarily to the alpha , , and  subunits of the GABA receptor,,, and not the alpha  subunit.The (BZ) receptor is found primarily on the Lamina IV of the brain sensorimotor cortical regions, substantia nigra (pars reticulata), cerebellum molecular layer, olfactory bulb, ventral thalamic complex, pons, inferior colliculus, and globus pallidus.

In chromium deficiency, intravenous administration of chromium resulted in normalization of the glucose tolerance curve from the diabetic-like curve typical of chromium deficiencyLabel.",[Cr],"Chromium is an essential nutrient involved in the metabolism of glucose, insulin and blood lipids. Its role in potentiating insulin signalling cascades has been implicated in several studies. Chromium upregulates insulin-stimulated insulin signal transduction via affecting effector molecules downstream of the insulin receptor (IR). IR-mediated signalling pathway involves phoshorylation of multiple intracellular domains and protein kinases, and downstream effector molecules. Upon activation by ligands, intracellular β-subunit of IR autophosphorylates and activates tyrosine kinase domain of the IR, followed by activation and phosphorylation of regulatory proteins and downstream signalling effectors including phosphatidylinositol -kinase (PIK). PIK activates further downstream reaction cascades to activate protein kinase B (Akt) to ultimately promote translocation of glucose transporter- (Glut)-vesicles from the cytoplasm to the cell surface and regulate glucose uptake. Chromium enhances the kinase activity of insulin receptor β and increases the activity of downstream effectors, pI-kinase and Akt.Under insulin-resistant conditions, chromium also promotes GLUT- transporter translocation that is independent of activity of IR, IRS-, PI-kinase, or Akt; chromium mediates cholesterol efflux from the membranes via increasing fluidity of the membrane by decreasing the membrane cholesterol and upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein. As a result, intracellular GLUT- transporters are stimulated to translocate from intracellular to the plasma membrane, leading to enhanced glucose uptake in muscle cells. Chromium attenuates the activity of PTP-Bin vitro,which is a negative regulator of insulin signaling. It also alleviates ER stress that is observed to be elevated the suppression of insulin signaling. ER stress is thought to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which subsequently induces serine phosphorylation of IRS and aberration of insulin signalling.

NOXA, which is a pro-apoptotic factor, induced by bortezomib selectively in cancer cells; thus, it is suggested to be another key mechanism of bortezomib.TargetActionsOrganismAProteasome subunit beta type-inhibitorHumansAProteasome subunit beta type-inhibitorHumans",[],"['Acids', 'Acids, Noncarboxylic', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents', 'Boron Compounds', 'Boronic Acids', 'Cardiotoxic antineoplastic agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Hepatotoxic Agents', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Myelosuppressive Agents', 'Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs', 'OATP1B3 inhibitors', 'P-glycoprotein substrates', 'P-glycoprotein substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Potential QTc-Prolonging Agents', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines', 'QTc Prolonging Agents']"

In the fetus and newborn, thyroid hormone is important for the growth and development of all tissues including bones and the brain. In adults, thyroid hormone helps to maintain brain function, food metabolism, and body temperature, among other effects. The symptoms of thyroid deficiency relieved by levothyroxine include slow speech, lack of energy, weight gain, hair loss, dry thick skin and unusual sensitivity to cold.The thyroid hormones have been shown to exert both genomic and non-genomic effects.They exert their genomic effects by diffusing into the cell nucleus and binding to thyroid hormone receptors in DNA regions called thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) near genes.This complex of T, T, DNA, and other coregulatory proteins causes a conformational change and a resulting shift in transcriptional regulation of nearby genes, synthesis of messenger RNA, and cytoplasmic protein production.,For example, in cardiac tissues Thas been shown to regulate the genes for α- and β-myosin heavy chains, production of the sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins calcium-activated ATPase (Ca+-ATPase) and phospholamban, β-adrenergic receptors, guanine-nucleotide regulatory proteins, and adenylyl cyclase types V and VI as well as several plasma-membrane ion transporters, such as Na+/K+–ATPase, Na+/Ca+ exchanger, and voltage-gated potassium channels, including Kv., Kv., and Kv..As a result, many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status.The non-genomic actions of the thyroid hormones have been shown to occur through binding to a plasma membrane receptor integrin aVb at the Arg-Gly-Asp recognition site.From the cell-surface, Tbinding to integrin results in down-stream effects including activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; ERK/) and causes subsequent effects on cellular/nuclear events including angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation.,TargetActionsOrganismAIntegrin alpha-VNot AvailableHumansAIntegrin beta-Not AvailableHumansAThyroid hormone receptor alphaagonistHumansAThyroid hormone receptor betaagonistHumans",[],"['Agents used to treat hypothyroidism', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Acids, Aromatic', 'Amino Acids, Cyclic', 'Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Hormones', 'Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists', 'Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs', 'OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors', 'OATP1B3 inhibitors', 'Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2B1 Inhibitors', 'P-glycoprotein inducers', 'Systemic Hormonal Preparations, Excl.

Haem is toxic to the malaria parasite. To prevent it from being damaged, the malaria parasite produces an chemical which converts the toxic haem into a non-toxic product. Primaquine acts by interfering with a part of the parasite (mitochondria) that is responsible for supplying it with energy. Without energy the parasite dies. This stops the infection from continuing and allows the person to recover. Primaquine kills the intrahepatic form ofPlasmodium vivaxandPlasmodium ovale, and thereby prevents the development of the erythrocytic forms that are responsible for relapses (it also kills gametocytes). Primaquine is not used in the prevention of malaria, only in the treatment.

Aminosalicylic acid binds pteridine synthetase with greater affinity than para-aminobenzoic acid, effectively inhibiting the synthesis of folic acid.

It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, lovastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.5,13,14,30Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.13Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.17,18,19,20,21Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.13,14Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.5,24,23Clinical studies have shown that lovastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 25-40%.5The 50% inhibitory dose is known to be of 46 mcg/kg which is translated into a reduction of approximately 30% of plasma cholesterol.2Myopathy/RhabdomyolysisLovastatin, like other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. The risk of myopathy is dose-related and is increased by high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma. In a clinical study (EXCEL)30in which patients were carefully monitored and some interacting drugs were excluded, there was one case of myopathy among 4933 patients randomized to lovastatin 20 to 40 mg daily for 48 weeks, and 4 among 1649 patients randomized to 80 mg daily.Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (≥65 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Chinese patients may also be at increased risk for myopathy. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued.The risk of myopathy during treatment with lovastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such asfenofibrate,niacin,gemfibrozil,cyclosporine, and strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme. Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered withcolchicine, and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.43,44Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.38Liver DysfunctionPersistent increases (to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal) in serum transaminases occurred in 1.9% of adult patients who received lovastatin for at least one year in early clinical trials. When the drug was interrupted or discontinued in these patients, the transaminase levels usually fell slowly to pretreatment levels. The increases usually appeared 3 to 12 months after the start of therapy with lovastatin, and were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms.43In the EXCEL study,30the incidence of persistent increases in serum transaminases over 48 weeks was 0.1% for placebo, 0.1% at 20 mg/day, 0.9% at 40 mg/day, and 1.5% at 80 mg/day in patients on lovastatin. However, in post-marketing experience with lovastatin, symptomatic liver disease has been reported rarely at all dosages.43",[H][C@]12[C@H](C[C@@H](C)C=C1C=C[C@H](C)[C@@H]2CC[C@@H]1C[C@@H](O)CC(=O)O1)OC(=O)[C@@H](C)CC,"Lovastatin is a lactone which is readily hydrolyzedin vivoto the corresponding β-hydroxyacid and strong inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic microsomal enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA (-hydroxy--methylglutaryl-coenzyme A ) to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.,At therapeutic lovastatin doses, HMG-CoA reductase is not completely blocked, thereby allowing biologically necessary amounts of mevalonate to be available. Because the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol, therapy with lovastatin would not be expected to cause an accumulation of potentially toxic sterols.Lovastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increase hepatic uptake of LDL. Lovastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL and a significant reduction in the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.,,,,A significant effect on LDL-C reduction was seen within  weeks of initiation of lovastatin, and the maximum therapeutic response occurred within - weeks. The response was maintained during continuation of therapy. Single daily doses given in the evening were more effective than the same dose given in the morning, perhaps because cholesterol is synthesized mainly at night. When therapy with lovastatin is stopped, total cholesterol has been shown to return to pre-treatment levels.In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that lovastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β integrin function-associated antigen- (LFA-), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.Lovastatin has been reported to have beneficial effects on certain cancers. This includes a multi-factorial stress-triggered cell death (apoptosis) and DNA degradation response in breast cancer cells.It has also been shown to inhibit histone deacetylase  (HDAC) activity and increase the accumulation of acetylated histone-H and the expression of p(WAF/CIP) in human cancer cells, suggesting that statins might serve as novel HDAC inhibitors for cancer therapy and chemoprevention.TargetActionsOrganismA-hydroxy--methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductaseinhibitorHumansUIntegrin alpha-LinhibitorHumansNHistone deacetylase inhibitorHumans",[],"['Agents Causing Muscle Toxicity', 'Anticholesteremic Agents', 'BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs causing inadvertant photosensitivity', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Hypolipidemic Agents', 'Hypolipidemic Agents Indicated for Hyperlipidemia', 'Lipid Modifying Agents', 'Lipid Regulating Agents', 'OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors', 'OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Substrates', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'UGT1A1 Substrates', 'UGT1A3 substrates', 'UGT2B7 substrates']"

DB00461,Nabumetone,Nabumetoneis an NSAID used to treat osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.,"['P35354', 'P23219']","NSAIDs, like nabumetone, are well established as analgesics. NSAIDs reduce both peripheral and central sensitization of nociceptive neurons due to inflammation which contribute to hyperalgesia and allodynia.9,6This sensitization occurs through reducing the action potential threshold in peripheral neurons, reducing the intensity of painful stimuli needed to produce a painful sensation. Centrally, activation of dorsal horn neurons occurs along with increased release of glutamate, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P which increase the transmission of painful stimuli. Coupled with this is an inhibition glycinergic neurons which normally inhibit pain transmission, a phenomenon known as disinhibition. Increased activity ofn-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors leads to the establishment of central sensitization, allowing both mild painful and innocuous stimuli to produce action potentials in nociceptive projection neurons. NSAIDs are effective in reducing mild-moderate acute and chronic nociceptive pain, however, the usefulness of NSAIDs in neuropathic pain is limited.The anti-inflammatory effect of NSAIDs is mediated by preventing vasodilation, increases in vascular permeability, and the release of cytokines from endothelial cells.9,7These three effects together prevent immunocompetent cells from migrating to the site of injury thereby preventing additional damage and inflammation due to activation of the immune system at the site of damage. PGs also modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation, an activity which is thought to be of importance in arthritic conditions.The anti-pyretic effect of NSAIDs is mediated through preventing increases in temperature by prostaglandins (PGs) via the hypothalamus.9Activation of this process by other inflammatory mediators relies upon subsequent action by PGs, therefore NSAIDs are able to reduce fever due to these mediators as well.The adverse effects of NSAIDs are related to their therapeutic effects.9The same vasodilatory action which occurs in inflammation also serves to regulate blood flow to the kidneys through the afferent renal arteries. NSAIDs are widely known as nephrotoxic agents as the reduction in PGs produces vasoconstriction of these arteries resulting in reduced blood flow to the kidneys and a subsequent decline in renal function. Reductions in mucus and HCO3-secretion in the stomach increases the risk of ulceration by limiting the protection mediated by PGs. Lastly, COX-2 selective agents like nabumetone can unbalance prothrombotic and antithrombotic prostanoid generation leading to increased platelet aggregation and increased risk of thrombosis.",COC1=CC2=C(C=C1)C=C(CCC(C)=O)C=C2,"Nabumetone's active metabolite, -MNA, is an inhibitor of both COX- and COX- although it exhibits some COX- selectivity.Label,Inhibition of COX- and COX- reduces conversion of arachidonic acid to PGs and thromboxane (TXA). This reduction in prostanoid production is the common mechanism that mediates the effects of nambutone.PGEis the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.,PGEactivates the Gq-coupled EPreceptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGEalso activates the EPreceptor, coupled to Gs, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member  (TRPV) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the PX purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGEact via EPto increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EPto further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EPreceptor which couples to Gs. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGIis known to play a role via its Gs-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.PGIand PGEcontribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EPreceptors.,Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are Gs-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGEalso contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.PGDplays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DPreceptor.PGIand PGEmodulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP, and EPreceptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.PGEcan cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory GqEPreceptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGEthereby reducing the activity of these neurons.The adverse effects of NSAIDs stem from the protective and regulatory roles of prostanoids which have been well-characterized.PGIand PGEregulate blood flow to the kidney by similar mechanisms to the vasodilation they produce in inflammation. Prevention of this regulation by NSAIDs produces vasoconstriction which limits renal function by reducing blood flow and the hydrostatic pressure which drives filtration. PGEalso regulates gastric protection via EPreceptors which are, in this location, coupled to Giwhich inhibits the AC/PKA pathway. This reduces the secretion of protons by H+/K+ATPase in parietal cells and increases the secretion of mucus and HCO-by superficial endothelial cells.

Regardless, the metabolism of diamorphine to morphine makes heroin a prodrug for the delivery of morphine,.Morphine is subsequently a mu-opioid agonist. It acts on endogenous mu-opioid receptors that are spread in discrete packets throughout the brain, spinal cord and gut in almost all mammals. Morphine, along with other opioids, are agonists to four endogenous neurotransmitters. They are beta-endorphin, dynorphin, leu-enkephalin, and met-enkephalin. The body responds to morphine in the brain by reducing (and sometimes stopping) production of the endogenous opioids when morphine is present. Endorphins are regularly released in the brain and nerves, attenuating pain. Their other functions are still obscure, but are probably related to the effects produced by morphine besides analgesia (antitussin, anti-diarrheal).Nevertheless, morphine ultimately elicits the majority of its analgesic activity by binding to mu opioid receptors in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The overall effect of morphine is activation of descending inhibitory pathways of the central nervous system as well as inhibition of nociceptive afferent neurons of the peripheral nervous system, which results in an overall reduction of the nociceptive pain transmission.TargetActionsOrganismAMu-type opioid receptoragonistHumansUKappa-type opioid receptoragonistHumansUDelta-type opioid receptoragonistHumansULiver carboxylesterase Not AvailableHumans",[],"['Alkaloids', 'Analgesics', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Drugs Used in Addictive Disorders', 'Drugs Used in Opioid Dependence', 'Heroin, agonists', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Morphinans', 'Morphine Derivatives', 'Narcotics', 'Nervous System', 'Opiate Agonists', 'Opiate Alkaloids', 'Opioids', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Phenanthrenes', 'Sensory System Agents', 'Thyroxine-binding globulin inducers']"

Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors.

There are at least five different types of calcium channels in Homo sapiens: L-, N-, P/Q-, R- and T-type. It was widely accepted that CCBs target L-type calcium channels, the major channel in muscle cells that mediates contraction; however, some studies have shown that felodipine also binds to and inhibits T-type calcium channels. T-type calcium channels are most commonly found on neurons, cells with pacemaker activity and on osteocytes. The pharmacologic significance of T-type calcium channel blockade is unknown. Felodipine also binds to calmodulin and inhibits calmodulin-dependent calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The effect of this interaction appears to be minor. Another study demonstrated that felodipine attenuates the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CaMPDE) by binding to the PDE-1B1 and PDE-1A2 enzyme subunits. CaMPDE is one of the key enzymes involved in cyclic nucleotides and calcium second messenger systems. Felodipine also acts as an antagonist to the mineralcorticoid receptor by competing with aldosterone for binding and blocking aldosterone-induced coactivator recruitment of the mineralcorticoid receptor. Felodipine is able to bind to skeletal and cardiac muscle isoforms of troponin C, one of the key regulatory proteins in muscle contraction. Though felodipine exhibits binding to many endogenous molecules, its vasodilatory effects are still thought to be brought about primarily through inhibition of voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. Similar to other DHP CCBs, felodipine binds directly to inactive calcium channels stabilizing their inactive conformation. Since arterial smooth muscle depolarizations are longer in duration than cardiac muscle depolarizations, inactive channels are more prevalent in smooth muscle cells. Alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel gives felodipine additional arterial selectivity. At therapeutic sub-toxic concentrations, felodipine has little effect on cardiac myocytes and conduction cells.",CCOC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(C)=C(C1C1=C(Cl)C(Cl)=CC=C1)C(=O)OC,"Felodipine decreases arterial smooth muscle contractility and subsequent vasoconstriction by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions through voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. It reversibly competes against nitrendipine and other DHP CCBs for DHP binding sites in vascular smooth muscle and cultured rabbit atrial cells. Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin. Calcium-bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. Inhibition of the initial influx of calcium decreases the contractile activity of arterial smooth muscle cells and results in vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of felodipine result in an overall decrease in blood pressure.

Drugs such as betaxolol that block these receptors therefore have the reverse effect: they lower the heart rate and blood pressure and hence are used in conditions when the heart itself is deprived of oxygen. They are routinely prescribed in patients with ischemic heart disease. In addition, beta(1)-selective blockers prevent the release of renin, which is a hormone produced by the kidneys which leads to constriction of blood vessels. Betaxolol is lipophilic and exhibits no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) or membrane stabilizing activity.",CC(C)NCC(O)COC1=CC=C(CCOCC2CC2)C=C1,"Betaxolol selectively blocks catecholamine stimulation of beta()-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle.

The pharmacological action is mediated by the active metabolite,nitric oxide, which is released when isosorbide mononitrate is metabolized.3Nitric oxide works on both arteries and veins, but predominantly veins: by relaxing veins and reducing the central venous pressure, nitric oxide causes venous pooling and a decrease in the venous return to the heart, thus decreasing cardiac preload.7In healthy subjects, the stroke volume is decreased and venous pooling can occur in the standing posture, leading to postural hypotension and dizziness.3At therapeutic doses of isosorbide mononitrate, nitric oxide has a bigger effect on larger muscular arteries over small resistance arteries. Arterial relaxation leads to reduced systemic vascular resistance and systolic blood (aortic) pressure, decreasing to decreased cardiac afterload.7,3The direct dilator effect on coronary arteries opposes the coronary artery spasm in variant angina or angina pectoris.3At larger doses, nitric oxide causes the resistance arteries and arterioles to dilate, reducing arterial pressure via coronary vasodilatation. This leads to increased coronary blood flow.7,3Reduced cardiac preload and afterload caused by nitric oxide causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption; decreased myocardial oxygen demand, along with increased coronary blood flow, leads to an increased in the oxygen content of coronary sinus blood3and the relief from ischemia.7The end effect of isosorbide mononitrate include decreased cardiac oxygen consumption, redistribution coronary flow toward ischemic areas via collaterals, and the relief of coronary spasms. Nitric oxide can also increase the rate of relaxation of cardiac muscles, which is an effect outside of vascular smooth muscles.3Organic nitrates can also relax other types of smooth muscles, including esophageal and biliary smooth muscle.3The anti-anginal activity of isosorbide mononitrate was observed about 1 hour after dosing, and the peak effect was achieved from 1-4 hours after dosing.4The duration of anti-anginal action of at least 12 hours was observed with an asymmetrical dosing regimen.2",[H][C@]12OC[C@@H](O[N+]([O-])=O)[C@@]1([H])OC[C@@H]2O,"Isosorbide mononitrate acts as a prodrug for nitric oxide (NO), which is a potent vasodilator gas that is released when the drug is metabolized.

At therapeutic doses, tramadol has no effect on heart rate, left-ventricular function or cardiac index. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed.29Tramadol produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centres. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem centres to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation.Tramadol depresses the cough reflex by a direct effect on the cough centre in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia.Tramadol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but
are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce
similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of
oxycodone overdose.30Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Risk of convulsions may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures
or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders,
alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections), or with concomitant use of other drugs known to reduce the seizure threshold.30Tramadol can cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs (e.g., anti-depressants, migraine medications). Treatment with the serotoninergic drug should be discontinued if such events (characterized by clusters of symptoms such as hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, mental status changes including confusion, irritability, extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. Tramadol should not be used in combination with MAO inhibitors or serotonin-precursors (such as L-tryptophan, oxitriptan) and should be used with caution in combination with other serotonergic drugs (triptans, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, St. John’s Wort) due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.30Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth MuscleTramadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.30Endocrine SystemOpioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or -gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes.30Hyponatremia has been reported very rarely with the use of tramadol, usually in patients with predisposing risk factors, such as elderly patients and/or patients using concomitant medications that may cause hyponatremia (e.g., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, diuretics). In some reports, hyponatremia appeared to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and resolved with discontinuation of tramadol and appropriate treatment (e.g., fluid restriction). During tramadol treatment, monitoring for signs and symptoms of hyponatremia is recommended for patients with predisposing risk factors.30CardiovascularTramadol administration may result in severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain adequate blood pressure is compromised by reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of drugs such as phenothiazines and other tranquillizers, sedative/hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or general anesthetics. These patients should be monitored for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of tramadol.30QTc-Interval ProlongationThe maximum placebo-adjusted mean change from baseline in the QTcF interval was 5.5 ms in the 400 mg/day treatment arm and 6.5 ms in the 600 mg/day mg treatment arm, both occurring at the 8h time point. Both treatment groups were within the 10 ms threshold for QT prolongation. Post-marketing experience with the use of tramadol containing products included rare reports of QT prolongation reported with an overdose. Particular care should be exercised when administering tramadol to patients who are suspected to be at an increased risk of experiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging drug.30Abuse and MisuseLike all opioids, tramadol has the potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Therefore, tramadol should be prescribed and handled with caution.30Dependence/TolerancePhysical dependence and tolerance reflect the neuroadaptation of the opioid receptors to chronic exposure to an opioid and are separate and distinct from abuse and addiction. Tolerance, as well as physical dependence, may develop upon repeated administration of opioids, and are not by themselves evidence of an addictive disorder or abuse. Patients on prolonged therapy should be tapered gradually from the drug if it is no longer required for pain control. Withdrawal symptoms may occur following abrupt discontinuation of therapy or upon administration of an opioid antagonist. Some of the symptoms that may be associated with abrupt withdrawal of an opioid analgesic include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.30",COC1=CC=CC(=C1)C1(O)CCCCC1CN(C)C,"Tramadol is a centrally acting μ-opioid receptor agonist and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related tocodeineandmorphine. Tramadol binds weakly to κ- and δ-opioid receptors and to the μ-opioid receptor with -fold less affinity than morphine.Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.In animal models, M is up to  times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and  times more potent in μ-opioid binding.Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of pain modulators including alpha-adrenoreceptors, neurokinin  receptors, the voltage-gated sodium channel type II alpha subunit, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member  (TRPV - also known as the capsaicin receptor), muscarinic receptors (M and M), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (also known as the NMDA receptor or glutamate receptor), Adenosine A receptors, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.In addition to the above neuronal targets, tramadol has a number of effects on inflammatory and immune mediators involved in the pain response.

Thiazides like methyclothiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of methyclothiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle.TargetActionsOrganismASolute carrier family  member inhibitorHumansUCarbonic anhydrase inhibitorHumansUCarbonic anhydrase inhibitorHumansUCarbonic anhydrase inhibitorHumans",[],"['Benzothiadiazines', 'Diuretics', 'Drugs causing inadvertant photosensitivity', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Hyperglycemia-Associated Agents', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'Increased Diuresis', 'Membrane Transport Modulators', 'Natriuretic Agents', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Sodium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors', 'Sulfonamides', 'Sulfones', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'Thiazides']"

After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTcF change was 8 ms - an increase that is generally not considered to be clinically significant26.Conversely, when used for treating major depressive disorder (MDD), non-clinical studies have shown that levomilnacipran binds with high affinity to the norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) transporters (Ki = 71-91 nM and 11 nM respectively at human transporters)24,25,26. Levomilnacipran inhibits the uptake of both NE and 5-HT in vitro and in vivo; preferentially inhibiting reuptake of NE over 5-HT by approximately 2-fold24,25,26.

In particular, it appears that the maximum therapeutic dose of levomilnacipran at 120 mg/day is capable of causing a maximum mean difference in heart rate from placebo of 20.2 bpm and a mean difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from placebo ranging from 3.8 to 7.2 mmHg and 6.1 to 8.1 mmHg, respectively24. Alternatively, a supratherapeutic dose of 300 mg/day is capable of causing a maximum mean difference in heart rate from placebo of 22.1 bpm and a mean difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from placebo ranging from 5.4 to 7.9 mmHg and 7.9 to 10.6 mmHg, respectively24.",CCN(CC)C(=O)C1(CC1CN)C1=CC=CC=C1,"The dual ability for milnacipran to inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin (HT) and norepinephrine (NE) facilitates its treatment of both fibromyalgia and major depressive disorder (MDD).In particular, it is generally believed that HT and NE participate in the modulation of endogenous analgesic mechanisms by way of the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord,,. Although the specific mechanism of action remains unclear, some studies have proposed that low levels of HT may be associated with increased sensitivity to pain - a condition that could subsequently be improved by milnacipran's capacity to enhance the presence of HT by inhibiting its reuptake via serotonin transporters at synaptic clefts,,. Furthermore, in the CNS it is also generally believed that NE released from descending pathways can mitigate pain sensations via eliciting inhibitory effects on alpha-A-adrenoceptors on central terminals of primary afferent nociceptors, by direct alpha--adrenergic action on pain-relay neurons, and by alpha--adrenoceptor-mediated activation of inhibitory interneurons. Such NE pain mitigation is consequently also enhanced by milnacipran's ability to enhance the presence of NE by inhibiting its reuptake via norepinephrine transporters at synaptic clefts.Concurrently, milnacipran's capacity to inhibit the reuptake of both HT and NE also facilitates its treatment of MDD. Given the monoamine hypothesis' assertion that decreased HT can be associated with anxiety, obsessions, compulsions, and decreased NE can result in lowered alertness, energy, attention, and general interest in life, it is proposed that milnacipran's basic activities as a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor could assist in treating such symptoms of MDD by increasing the presence of both HT and NE in the body by inhibiting their reuptake.TargetActionsOrganismASodium-dependent serotonin transporterinhibitorHumansASodium-dependent noradrenaline transporterinhibitorHumansUNMDA receptorinhibitorHumans",[],"['Adrenergic Agents', 'Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors', 'Agents producing tachycardia', 'Analgesics', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Combined Inhibitors of Serotonin/Norepinephrine Reuptake', 'Cyclopropanes', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Hypoglycemia-Associated Agents', 'Membrane Transport Modulators', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'Neurotransmitter Uptake Inhibitors', 'Norepinephrine Uptake Inhibitors', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Psychoanaleptics', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors', 'Sensory System Agents', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Serotonin Agents', 'Serotonin and Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors', 'Serotonin Modulators']"

When activated, presynaptic -HTAautoreceptors causes neuron hyperpolarization and reduces the firing rate of the serotonergic neuron, thereby decreasing extracellular -HT levels in the neuron's projection areas. Activated postsynaptic -HTAreceptors promote hyperpolarization to released -HT on pyramidal neurons.The anxiolytic action of buspirone is mainly thought to arise from the interaction at presynaptic -HTAautoreceptors. Acting as a potent agonist in these receptors, buspirone initially causes activation of these autoreceptors and inhibition of -HT release. It is proposed that buspirone induces desensitization of somatodendritic autoreceptors over time, which may explain the delayed onset of action of the drug. Desensitization of the autoreceptors ultimately results in heightened excitation of serotonergic neurons and enhanced -HT release.Buspirone also displays a weak affinity for serotonin HT receptors and acts as a weak antagonist on dopamine D autoreceptors,although there is not much evidence that the action at these receptors contribute to the anxiolytic effect of buspirone.It acts as an antagonist at presynaptic dopamine D and D receptors and may bind to alpha- adrenergic receptors as a partial agonist.TargetActionsOrganismA-hydroxytryptamine receptor Apartial agonistHumansADopamine D receptorantagonistHumansUDopamine D receptorantagonistHumansUDopamine D receptorantagonistHumansUAlpha- adrenergic receptorspartial agonistHumans",[],"['Agents that produce hypertension', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Azaspirodecanedione Derivatives', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Dopamine Antagonists', 'Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Miscellaneous Anxiolytics Sedatives and Hypnotics', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'Piperazines', 'Psycholeptics', 'Pyrimidines', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Serotonin Agents', 'Spiro Compounds', 'Tranquilizing Agents']"

The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin- (annexin-) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX- and COX-) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin- escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.TargetActionsOrganismAAnnexin ANot AvailableHumansAGlucocorticoid receptorNot AvailableHumansUCorticosteroid -beta-dehydrogenase isozyme Not AvailableHumansU beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta -->-isomerase type Not AvailableHumans",['Postoperative Eye Care'],"['11-Hydroxycorticosteroids', '17-Hydroxycorticosteroids', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Aerosols', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Corticosteroids', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Fused-Ring Compounds', 'Hormones', 'Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists', 'Hydrocortisone and derivatives', 'Hydroxycorticosteroids', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Pregnanes', 'Pregnenediones', 'Pregnenes', 'Steroids']"

The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D2, D3and D4subreceptors and has been associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D2and D3receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. It is thought that postsynaptic D2 stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists, while presynaptic D2 stimulation confers neuroprotective effects.

Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity (e.g. movement, balance, walking), loss of activity may result in dystonia (acute muscle contraction), Parkinsonism (including symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and flattened affect), akathesia (inner restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long-term loss of dopaminergic activity), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT2Aagonism.

In this pathway, dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin. Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion.

Technically, the term corticosteroid refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, but is often used as a synonym for glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also leads to fewer T lymphocyte cells being activated.",[H][C@@]12C[C@@H](C)[C@](O)(C(=O)CO)[C@@]1(C)C[C@H](O)[C@@]1([H])[C@@]2([H])C[C@H](F)C2=CC(=O)C=C[C@]12C,"Glucocorticoids such as paramethasone can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. The antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids are thought to involve phospholipase A inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Paramethasone reduces inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins. Recent research suggests that corticosteroids may inhibit the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins. Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. On binding, the corticoreceptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes.

While bound silver ions do not exert antibacterial actions, they may potentially play a role in silver toxicity in case of chronic exposure. Silver ions mediate antibacterial effects via disrupting the bacterial, fungal, and protozoal cell membranes; they bind to disulphide in membrane proteins, readily allowing penetration through the membranes and intracellular absorption via pinocytosis. They may also bind to negatively-charged peptidoglycans in the cell wall via electrostatic interactions, leading to disruption of membrane transport function and loss of structural integrity. Silver ions also bind to and oxidize sulphydryl groups (SH) in bacterial cytoplasmic enzymes to aberrate their function in metabolic processes. Silver nanoparticles may cause an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside the microbial cells leading to metal-induced oxidative stress and cell damage. They also modulate cellular signal system via inhibition of phosphorylation of essential bacterial proteins to eventually cause cell death. It is also reported that silver ions also attach to guanine in bacterial DNA, which inhibits DNA replication.

As a result, there is a leak of potassium ions which results in the repolarization of cells and a decrease in neuronal excitability. The overall impact is the impairment of neuromuscular transmission as it is harder to trigger an action potential.
Dalfampridine inhibits voltage-gated potassium channels in the CNS to maintain the transmembrane potential and prolong action potential. In other words, dalfampridine works to make sure that the current available is high enough to stimulate conduction in demyelinated axons that are exposed in MS patients.

If pregnancy occurs, progesterone levels in the body remain high, maintaining the womb lining. If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels in the body fall, resulting in a menstrual period. Ethynodiol Diacetate tricks the body processes into thinking that ovulation has already occurred, by maintaining high levels of the synthetic progesterone.

Typical, drugs that treat post-menopausal symptoms such as estrogen, have a proliferative effect on the endometrium, increasing the risk of endometrial carcinoma8. The effects on the bone, brain and vaginal tissues can be explained by the estrogenic activity of tibolone. It is important to note that activity is not expressed in the endometrium. Tibolone behaves differently from estrogen plus progesterone combinations on the breast. Therefore, tibolone can be characterized as a selective estrogen activity regulator1.Tibolone has been demonstrated to be an effective agent in treating symptoms associated with menopause.

Women treated with tibolone showed improvement from baseline in typical menopausal symptoms including hot flashes, sweating, insomnia, and anxiety14.",[H][C@@]12CC[C@@](O)(C#C)[C@@]1(C)CC[C@]1([H])C3=C(CC(=O)CC3)C[C@@]([H])(C)[C@@]21[H],"This drug's effects are owed to the activity of its metabolites in various tissues.Upon ingestion, tibolone is quickly converted into three major metabolites: alpha- and  beta-hydroxy-tibolone, which have oestrogenic effects, and theDelta()-isomer, which has progestogenic and androgenic effects. The specific tissue-selective effects of tibolone occur due to the metabolism, regulation of enzymes and receptor activation that varies in different tissues of the body.The bone-conserving effects occur due to estradiol receptor activation, while the progesterone and androgen receptors are not involved in this process. Breast tissue of monkeys is not found to be stimulated after tibolone administration, as occurs with estrogen plus progesterone used in combination. This is explained by the fact that tibolone and its metabolites inhibitsulphatase and  beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase(HSD) type I andstimulate sulphotransferase and  beta-HSD type II. The combined effects of this process prevent the conversion to active estrogens.In the uterus, the progestogenic activity of theDelta()-metaboliteand the effect on estrogen-inactivating enzymes prevent estrogenic stimulation. The mammary gland is not stimulated in currently used animal models. Tibolone has been shown to regulate estrogenic activity in several tissue types by influencing the availability of estrogenic compounds for the estradiol receptor in a selective manner.Additionally, tibolone modulates cellular homeostasis in the breast by preventing breast tissue proliferation and stimulating cell apoptosis. Tibolone does not stimulate the endometrium because of the action of its highly stable progestogenic metabolite (Delta()-isomer) in combination with an effect on the sulfatase (inhibition)-sulfotransferase (stimulation) system. The estrogenic metabolites of tibolone have direct, favorable effects on the cardiovascular system and, in animal models, this drug has shown no adverse consequences.The tissue-selective effects of tibolone are the result of metabolism, enzyme regulation and receptor activation that vary in different tissues. The bone-preserving effects of tibolone are the result of estradiol receptor activation, while other steroid receptors, mainly the progesterone and androgen receptors, are not involved in this process.In a study of monkeys, breast tissue was not stimulated, which occurs with estrogen and progesterone, because tibolone and its metabolites inhibitsulfatase and  beta-hydroxysteroid _dehydrogenase (HSD) type I and stimulate _sulfotransferase and  beta-HSD type II. The simultaneous effects of this process halt conversion to active estrogens. Additionally, tibolone affects cellular homeostasis in the breast by preventing proliferation and stimulating apoptosis. Tibolone does not stimulate the endometrium due to the action of the highly stable progestogenic metabolite (Delta()-isomer) in combination with an effect on the sulphatase (inhibition)-sulphotransferase (stimulation) pathway.The levels of tibolone metabolites and the alteration of hormonal activities vary according to the tissue type. In endometrial tissue theΔ-isomerfunctions as a progestagen, however, in the brain and liver, it shows androgenic effects.

DB06736,Aceclofenac,"Aceclofenac is an oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with marked anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties used to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. It is reported to have a higher anti-inflammatory action or at least comparable effects than conventional NSAIDs in double-blind studies2,3,5. Aceclofenac potently inhibits the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme (COX) that is involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are inflammatory mediators that cause pain, swelling, inflammation, and fever. Aceclofenac belongs to BCS Class II as it possesses poor aqueous solubility2. It displays high permeability to penetrate into synovial joints where in patients with osteoarthritis and related conditions, the loss of articular cartilage in the area causes joint pain, tenderness, stiffness, crepitus, and local inflammation1. Aceclofenac is also reported to be effective in other painful conditions such as dental and gynaecological conditions7. In 1991, aceclofenac was developed as an analog of a commonly prescribed NSAID,Diclofenac, via chemical modification in effort to improve the gastrointestinal tolerability of the drug. It is a more commonly prescribed drug in Europe.","['P35354', 'P23219']","Aceclofenac is a NSAID that inhibits both isoforms of COX enzyme, a key enzyme involved in the inflammatory cascade. COX-1 enzyme is a constitutive enzyme involved in prostacyclin production and protective functions of gastric mucosa whereas COX-2 is an inducible enzyme involved in the production of inflammatory mediators in response to inflammatory stimuli. Aceclofenac displays more selectivity towards COX-2 (IC50 of 0.77uM) than COX-1 (IC50 of >100uM), which promotes its gastric tolerance compared to other NSAIDs. The primary metabolite, 4'-hydroxyaceclofenac, also minimally inhibits COX-2 with IC50 value of 36uM2. Although the mode of action of aceclofenac is thought to mainly arise from the inhibition of synthesis of prostaglandins (PGE2), aceclofenac also inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines, interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6), and tumor necrosis factors (TNF)1,2. It is also reported that aceclofenac also affects the cell adhesion molecules from neutrophils8. Aceclofenac also targets the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan and mediates chrondroprotective effects1.",OC(=O)COC(=O)CC1=CC=CC=C1NC1=C(Cl)C=CC=C1Cl,"Through COX- inhibition, aceclofenac downregulates the production of various inflammatory mediators including prostaglandin E (PGE), IL-β, and TNF from the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Inhibition of IL- is thought to be mediated by diclofenac converted from aceclofenac. Suppressed action of inflammatory cytokines decreases the production of reactive oxygen species. Aceclofenac is shown to decreased production of nitrous oxide in human articular chondrocytes. In addition, aceclofenac interferes with neutrophil adhesion to endothelium by decreasing the expression of L-selectin (CDL), which is a cell adhesion molecule expressed on lymphocytes. Aceclofenac is proposed to stimulate the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan in human osteoarthritic cartilage which may be mediated through its inhibitory action on IL- production and activity. The chrondroprotective effects are generated by '-hydroxyaceclofenac which suppresses IL- mediated production of promatrix metalloproteinase- and metalloproteinase- and interferes with the release of proteoglycan from chrondrocytes,,.TargetActionsOrganismAProstaglandin G/H synthase inhibitorHumansAProstaglandin G/H synthase inhibitorHumans",[],"['Acetic Acid Derivatives and Related Substances', 'Acids, Carbocyclic', 'Agents causing hyperkalemia', 'Agents that produce hypertension', 'Analgesics', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal (Non-Selective)', 'Antiinflammatory and Antirheumatic Products', 'Antiinflammatory and Antirheumatic Products, Non-Steroids', 'Antiinflammatory Preparations, Non-Steroids for Topical Use', 'Antirheumatic Agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Musculo-Skeletal System', 'Nephrotoxic agents', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Phenylacetates', 'Selective Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors (NSAIDs)', 'Sensory System Agents', 'Topical Products for Joint and Muscular Pain']"

In the case of HSV, VZV and EBV this enzyme is the viralthymidine kinase(TK), which is only found in virus-infected cells. The process of phosphorylation is completed (conversion from mono- to triphosphate) by cellular kinases. Acyclovir triphosphate competitively inhibits the virus DNA polymerase and incorporation of this agent results in DNA chain termination, stopping virus DNA synthesis and blocking virus replication.

Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cyclic GMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The tissue concentration of cyclic GMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs), and the most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is PDE.

Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme α-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about . times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing androgen effects.Such activities are useful as endogenous androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. These effects include the growth and maturation of the prostate, seminal vesicles, penis, and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as facial, pubic, chest, and axillary hair; laryngeal enlargement, vocal cord thickening, and alterations in body musculature and fat distribution.Male hypogonadism, a clinical syndrome resulting from insufficient secretion of testosterone, has two main etiologies. Primary hypogonadism is caused by defects of the gonads, such as Klinefelter’s syndrome or Leydig cell aplasia, whereas secondary hypogonadism is the failure of the hypothalamus (or pituitary) to produce sufficient gonadotropins (FSH, LH).TargetActionsOrganismAAndrogen receptoragonistHumansUEstrogen receptor alphaNot AvailableHumansUMineralocorticoid receptorNot AvailableHumans",[],"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Androgens', 'Androstanes', 'Androstenes', 'Androstenols', 'BCRP/ABCG2 Substrates', 'Contraceptive Agents, Male', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Fused-Ring Compounds', 'Gonadal Hormones', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormonal Contraceptives for Systemic Use', 'Hormones', 'Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists', 'OAT3/SLC22A8 Inducers', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'Steroids', 'Testosterone and derivatives', 'Testosterone Congeners', 'Thyroxine-binding globulin inhibitors']"

It is also involved in apoptosis and other cellular events mediated by nitric oxide production. As a coenzyme, BH reacts with molecular oxygen to form an active oxygen intermediate that can hydroxylate substrates.

During sexual arousal, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons release nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).,cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) in a signal cascade which activates K+ channels leading to inhibition of Ca+ channels, inhibits platelet activation, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. This signal cascade is attenuated by PDE which breaks the phosphodiester bond of cGMP, converting it to GMP. Inhibition of PDE by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca+ entry into smooth muscle cells. This smooth muscle relaxation allows blood to fill the corpus cavernosum thereby producing an erection.In PAH, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is raised due to a variety of mechanisms stemming from endothelial dysfunction.Decreased production of NO and prostacyclin reduce vasodilatory signaling while overproduction of endothelin- and thromboxane increase vasoconstriction. Inflammation, thromboses, and hypoxia later contribute to vascular remodeling which further reduces luminal size. The resultant increase in blood pressure reduces the capacity for gas exchange and increases afterload at the right ventricle, producing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness as well as leading to right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil exerts its therapeutic effect in PAH through boosting NO-cGMP signaling to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation as with ED.Lastly, tadalafil is used to treat BPH.BPH produces urinary dysfunction through hyperproliferation of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the prostate.The increased size of the prostate blocks urine flow through the urethra resulting in higher residual volumes due to incomplete emptying. Tadalafil does not appear to exert its benefit via smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade.The decreased affinity for PDE compared to other PDE inhibitors may explain the decreased incidence of visual side effects as PDE is present in the eye and contributes to color vision.,,TargetActionsOrganismAcGMP-specific ','-cyclic phosphodiesteraseinhibitorHumansNDual ','-cyclic-AMP and -GMP phosphodiesterase AinhibitorHumansNRetinal rod rhodopsin-sensitive cGMP ','-cyclic phosphodiesterase subunit gammainhibitorHumans",[],"['5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Antihypertensives for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension', 'Carbolines', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Drugs Used in Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy', 'Drugs Used in Erectile Dysfunction', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Genito Urinary System and Sex Hormones', 'Genitourinary Agents', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Indole Alkaloids', 'Indoles', 'Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors', 'Pyridines', 'Urological Agents', 'Urologicals', 'Vasodilating Agents']"

In particular, IBS that features constipation as a predominant effect is categorized as constipation-predominant IBS, or IBS-C,.Concurrently, -Hydroxytryptamine (-HT, or serotonin) has demonstrated the ability to elicit significant regulatory actions on gastrointestinal motility. Specifically, it has been shown that the activation of -HT() receptors located on motor neurons and interneurons in the gastrointestinal wall can cause the release of acetylcholine, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide that can all facilitate the propulsion of material through the gut. Moreover, when -HT() receptors located in smooth muscle cells are also activated, activities that may alleviate symptoms of IBS-C like esophageal relaxation and the inhibition of human colonic circular muscle contraction can also occur. Additionally, activating -HT() on enteric neurons and enterocytes also cause natural fluid secretion in the gut - an action which also strongly assists in promoting the movement of content along the gastrointestinal tract.Alternatively, it has also been observed that -HT may participate in generating visceral hyperalgesia in IBS, an observation supported in part by the finding of increased amounts of -HT and its metabolites in the plasma of patients experiencing IBSIt has therefore also been proposed that antagonism of -HT(B) receptors can lead to inhibition of both -HT mediated gastrointestinal motility and visceral hypersensitivity.Subsequently, because tegaserod is considered to be an agonist of the -HT() receptor and an antagonist of the -HT(B) receptor at clinically relevant levels, it is believed that tegaserod may elicit its mechanism of action by facilitating activities associated with the activation and antagonism of the -HT() and -HT(B) receptors, like stimulating peristaltic gastrointestinal reflexes and intestinal secretion, inhibiting visceral sensitivity, enhancing basal motor activity, and normalizing impaired motility throughout the gastrointestinal tract, among other actions,,,,.TargetActionsOrganismA-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonistpartial agonistHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor CantagonistHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor AantagonistHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor BantagonistHumans",[],"['Alimentary Tract and Metabolism', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'BCRP/ABCG2 Substrates', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (moderate)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs for Constipation', 'Gastrointestinal Agents', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Laxatives', 'P-glycoprotein substrates', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Serotonin 4 Receptor Agonists', 'Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Antagonists', 'Serotonin 5-HT2A Receptor Antagonists', 'Serotonin 5-HT2C Receptor Antagonists', 'Serotonin Agents', 'Serotonin Receptor Antagonists', 'Serotonin-4 Receptor Agonist']"

Contraction of the ciliary muscle via Mreceptor signalling also leads to accommodation, adjusting the lens for near vision.The eye is also innervated by parasympathetic nerves: ciliary ganglion neurons project to the ciliary body and the sphincter pupillae muscle of the iris to control ocular accommodation and pupil constriction.Tropicamide is a non-selective muscarinic antagonist that binds to all subtypes of muscarinic receptors.

Pantoprazole administration leads to long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion.16General EffectsPantoprazole has been shown to reduce acid reflux-related symptoms, heal inflammation of the esophagus, and improve patient quality of life more effectively than histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers). This drug has an excellent safety profile and a low incidence of drug interactions. It can be used safely in various high-risk patient populations, including the elderly and those with renal failure or moderate hepatic dysfunction.1Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinalC. difficile), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.12PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes14,15.A note on laboratory testing abnormalitiesDuring treatment with antisecretory medicinal products such as pantoprazole, serum gastrin (a peptide hormone that stimulates secretion of gastric acid) increases in response to the decreased acid secretion caused by proton pump inhibition. The increased gastrin level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be stopped 14 days before chromogranin A (CgA) measurements. This permits chromogranin A levels, that might be falsely elevated after proton pump inhibitor treatment, to return to the normal reference range.21Reports have been made of false-positive results in urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving the majority of proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole.

In current literature, the pathophysiology of ADHD is understood to involve the imbalance of neurotransmitters, especially dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE).The mechanism of action of viloxazine has not been fully elucidated; however, viloxazine is believed to work by modulating the monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems. Viloxazine is a selective and moderate norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that binds to the norepinephrine transporter and inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine.,It thereby increases extracellular norepinephrine levels across several brain regions.Viloxazine potentiates serotonergic effects: it was shown to enhance neuronal sensitivity to serotonin and increase serotonin levels in the brain.,In vitro, viloxazine is an antagonist at -HTBreceptors and an agonist -HTCreceptors.,-HTBreceptors expressed on GABAergic interneurons are involved in tonic inhibitory control of serotonin neurons that innervate the medial prefrontal context; thus, antagonism of -HTBreceptors may result in disinhibition and enhanced serotonin release in the brain region.There is conflicting evidence in the literature that viloxazine increases dopamine levels in the brain via direct or indirect effects. For example, the norepinephrine transporter is also involved in the reuptake of dopamine in the prefrontal cortexand stimulation of -HTCreceptors facilitates DA release and enhances dopaminergic transmission in the brain.As dopamine dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala is implicated in ADHD pathophysiology, the impact of viloxazine on dopamine levels may contribute to its mechanism of action.

Overall, intracellular calcium levels rise, which bind calmodulin and cause muscular contraction, resulting in vasoconstriction.This is balanced by the apparent ability of vasopressin to induce vasodilation through binding oxytocin receptors and activating endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase; NO acts antagonistically to reduce muscle contraction.It is also thought that vasopressin, acting through both Vand oxytocin receptors, causes the cardiac release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which has a negative inotropic effect; indeed, vasopressin tends to decrease heart rate and cardiac output, although the opposite effect has been noted with low doses.,Vreceptors are abundantly expressed in the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts of the kidneys.,Vasopressin binding to Vcauses activation of a Gsprotein that subsequently activates protein kinase A (PKA) through adenylyl cyclase-mediated increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which leads to phosphorylation of the water channel aquaporin- (AQP) and its trafficking to the cell surface.,Increased AQP levels lead to increased water reabsorption and explains vasopressin's antidiuretic effects.V(formerly VB) receptors are primarily located in the anterior pituitary and brain.,Vasopressin released during acute stress causes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release from the pituitary through Vand by potentiating the effects of corticotrophin-releasing factor. Within the brain itself, Vactivation modulates various effects, including recognition, memory, aggression, anxiety, and depression.Thus, vasopressin can affect a wide variety of physiological processes, often in apparently contradictory ways depending on the patient's dose and physiological state. Vasodilatory shock causes an immediate release of vasopressin from  to  times its normal serum concentration, which falls again to normal levels in prolonged shock; in this context, normal serum levels are insufficient to control the pathologic vasodilation.,In these cases, vasopressin acts to depolarize hyperpolarized vascular smooth muscle cells, restore sensitivity to catecholamines, and inhibit excessive nitric oxide production, primarily through acting through Vreceptors.

Aromatase (exemestane) is the principal enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens both in pre- and postmenopausal women. While the main source of estrogen (primarily estradiol) is the ovary in premenopausal women, the principal source of circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women is from conversion of adrenal and ovarian androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens (estrone and estradiol) by the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Estrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for some postmenopausal patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer. Exemestane is an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator, structurally related to the natural substrate androstenedione. It irreversibly binds to the active site causing permanent inhibition necessitating de novo synthesis to restore enzymatic function. Exemestane significantly lowers circulating estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women, but has no detectable effect on the adrenal biosynthesis of corticosteroids or aldosterone. This reduction in serum and tumor concentrations of estrogen delays tumor growth and disease progression.

They also play a role in the formation of the mitotic spindle and chromosomal segregation to the daughter cells at mitosis. Via GTP hydrolysis at the β-tubulin subunit and polymerization of tubulin into linear polymers, microtubules, or macromolecular filaments composed of tubulin heterodimers, are formed via a mechanism of nucleation-elongation. At the onset of mitosis, the interphase microtubule network disassembles into the tubulin. The tubulin reassembles into a new population of mitotic spindle microtubules that further undergo rapid successions of lengthening and shortening until they are attached to the newly duplicated sister chromatids at their centromeres. The dynamic behaviour of microtubules are characterized by two mechanical process: dynamic instability indicating repeated switches of growth and shortening at the ends, and microtubule treadmilling that involves the fast-growing (+) end of the microtubule accompanied by a net loss of the opposite slow-growing (-) end. Microtubule treadmilling plays a critical role in mitosis by generating the forces for separation of the chromosomes in the mitotic spindle from centrosome and kinetochores.In both cancer and normal cells, vinflunine binds to tubulin at or near to the vinca binding sites at β-tubulin. It is proposed that in similarity to other vinca alkaloids, vinflunine is most likely to bind to β-tubulin subunit at the interdimer interface. Via direct binding to tubulin, vinflunine inhibits microtubule polymerization and induces a G+M arrest, or a mitotic arrest. Vinflunine disrupts the dynamic function of microtubules by suppressing treadmilling and slowing the microtubule growth rate while increasing growth duration.

The type II a-reductase isozyme is primarily found in the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymides, and hair follicles as well as liver, and is responsible for two-thirds of circulating DHT.Due to its dual inhibition of both isoenzymes of α-reductase, dutasteride causes a near-complete suppression of DHT.Compared to a % reduction of serum DHT levels caused byfinasteride, a near-complete suppression of serum DHT-more than % is seen with dutasteride.By forming a stable complex with both type II and type II α-reductase, dutasteride inhibits its enzymatic action of converting testosterone to α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland.

They are involved in essential cellular functions, such as DNA transcription and DNA repair.PARPs recognize and repair cellular DNA damage, such as single-strand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs). Different DNA repair pathways exist to repair these DNA damages, including the base excision repair (BER) pathway for SSBs and BRCA-dependent homologous recombination for DSBs.Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor: while it acts on PARP, PARP, and PARP, olaparib is a more selective competitive inhibitor of NAD+at the catalytic site of PARP and PARP. Inhibition of the BER pathway by olaparib leads to the accumulation of unrepaired SSBs, which leads to the formation of DSBs, which is the most toxic form of DNA damage. While BRCA-dependent homologous recombination can repair DSBs in normal cells, this repair pathway is defective in cells with BRCA/ mutations, such as certain tumour cells.Inhibition of PARP in cancer cells with BRCA mutations leads to genomic instability and apoptotic cell death. This end result is also referred to as synthetic lethality, a phenomenon where the combination of two defects - inhibition of PARP activity and loss of DSB repair by HR - that are otherwise benign when alone, lead to detrimental results.In vitrostudies have shown that olaparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes, resulting in DNA damage and cancer cell death.TargetActionsOrganismAPoly [ADP-ribose] polymerase inhibitorHumansAPoly [ADP-ribose] polymerase inhibitorHumansAPoly [ADP-ribose] polymerase inhibitorHumansUAldo-keto reductase family  member CinhibitorHumans",['Maintenance therapy'],"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents', 'BCRP/ABCG2 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2B6 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inhibitors (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'MATE 1 Inhibitors', 'MATE 2-K Inhibitors', 'MATE inhibitors', 'Myelosuppressive Agents', 'Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs', 'OAT3/SLC22A8 Inhibitors', 'OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inhibitors', 'OCT1 inhibitors', 'OCT2 Inhibitors', 'P-glycoprotein inhibitors', 'P-glycoprotein substrates', 'P-glycoprotein substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Pyridazines', 'UGT1A1 Inhibitors']"

Candesartan confers blood pressure lowering effects by antagonizing the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II via the RAAS. RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. Renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by increasing total peripheral resistance, increasing sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys via aldosterone secretion, and altering cardiovascular structure. Angiotensin II binds to two receptors: type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) and type-2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2). AT1 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates the vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Studies performed in recent years suggest that AT2 antagonizes AT1-mediated effects and directly affects long-term blood pressure control by inducing vasorelaxation and increasing urinary sodium excretion. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are non-peptide competitive inhibitors of AT1. ARBs block the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate pressor and cell proliferative effects. Unlike ACE inhibitors, ARBs do not affect bradykinin-induced vasodilation.

They inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively and act as a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. The concentration of drug necessary to effect viral replication by 50 percent (EC50) ranged from 3.7 to 5.8 μM (1 μM = 0.28 mcg/mL) and 0.07 to 1.0 μM against HIV-1IIIB and HIV-1BaL, respectively, and was 0.26 ± 0.18 μM against 8 clinical isolates. Abacavir had synergistic activity in cell culture in combination with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) zidovudine, the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) nevirapine, and the protease inhibitor (PI) amprenavir; and additive activity in combination with the NRTIs didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zalcitabine.",NC1=NC2=C(N=CN2[C@@H]2C[C@H](CO)C=C2)C(NC2CC2)=N1,"Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue and an antiviral agent.

Hyaluronic acid has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects.2The water-balancing properties and viscoelasticity of hyaluronic acid are beneficial in cosmetic injections, imparting volume and reducing the appearance of imperfections and wrinkles.17Due to the abovementioned properties, HA has a protective effect on the eyes and cornea.3",CC(=O)N[C@H]1[C@H](O)O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)C1O[C@@H]1O[C@@H]([C@@H](O[C@@H]2O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)C(O[C@@H]3O[C@@H]([C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H]3O)C(O)=O)[C@H]2NC(C)=O)[C@H](O)[C@H]1O)C(O)=O,"General principles and hyaluronic acid receptor bindingHyaluronic acid works by two basic mechanisms: serving as a passive structural molecule or serving as signaling molecule, depending on the molecule size. The physicochemical properties of high molecular weight HA contribute to passive structural effects, demonstrating hygroscopicity and viscoelasticity and improving hydration, water balance, and structural integrity. As a signalling molecule interacting with proteins, HA causes several opposing effects based on molecular weight: pro- or anti-inflammatory effects, promotion or inhibition of cell migration, and activating or inhibiting cell division.Hyaluronic acid exerts its therapeutic effects through binding to three primary types of cell surface receptors: CD (a membrane glycoprotein), the receptor for hyaluronate-mediated motility (RHAMM), and the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule  (ICAM-). CD is considered the most widely distributed receptor for hyaluronic acid, demonstrating cellular interactions with osteopontin, collagen, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). High and low molecular weight hyaluronic acids demonstrate differing molecular and cellular mechanisms in their interaction with CD receptors. Some examples of these effects include modification of chondrocyte survival pathways in addition to alteration of apoptosis pathways. Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor (LYVE-), and hyaluronic acid receptor for endocytosis (HARE), (also known as Stabilin-) also bind to hyaluronic acid.Hyaluronic acid for skin conditions and cosmeticsHyaluronic acid's anionic proprieties cause it to attract water and induce swelling, increasing tissue volume and skin structural integrity. The aging process is associated with reduced production of skin hyaluronic acid and collagen, causing the appearance of wrinkles and the loss of facial volume. Dermal fillers of hyaluronic acid replace lost tissue volume, imparting a full and youthful appearance to skin that has lost its elasticity. Hyaluronic acid fillers contain cross-linked hyaluronic acid particles, rendering a concentrated substance with resistance to various forms of physical and chemical breakdown. The cosmetic benefits of hyaluronic acid filler may last up to  months, depending on the brand and technique used for injection.Additionally, dermal hyaluronic acid fillers are known to increase the production of fibroblasts, supporting wound healing and offering relief from irritating and inflammatory skin conditions.Hyaluronic acid for joint painMost cells in the human body are capable of synthesizing HA. It is a primary component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and can be found in bone marrow, cartilage, and synovial fluid in joints.In osteoarthritis, the concentration of naturally occurring hyaluronic acid gradually decreases, lowering the viscosity of synovial fluid that protects joints from excess friction. Administration of intra-articular hyaluronic acid increases viscosity of synovial joint fluid, reducing friction and subsequently relieving painful arthritic symptoms.Hyaluronic acid for ophthalmic conditions and ophthalmological proceduresSolutions of hyaluronic acid with a concentration greater than .% moisturize the surface of the eyes to treat symptoms of dry eye while improving the stabilization of tear film, replenishing deficiencies of HA, reducing friction, and preventing binding of foreign substances to the ocular tissue.,Hyaluronic acid is frequently used during and after ophthalmological surgeries and plays important roles by virtue of its moisturizing, viscoelastic, and protective properties. It promotes tissue healing of the corneal epithelium and other parts of the eye following ophthalmological surgery, minimizing the risk of adhesions and free radical formation.TargetActionsOrganismACD antigenbinderHumansAIntercellular adhesion molecule inhibitorbinderHumansAHyaluronan mediated motility receptorbinderHumansUNeurocan core proteinbinderHumansUVersican core proteinbinderHumansUComplement component  Q subcomponent-binding protein, mitochondrialbinderHumansUHyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein binderHumansUHyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein binderHumansUHyaluronan-binding protein binderHumansULayilinbinderHumansUStabilin-binderHumansUTumor necrosis factor-inducible gene  proteinbinderHumansUInterphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan binderHumansUIntracellular hyaluronan-binding protein binderHumansULymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor Not AvailableHumans","['Dermal Filler', 'Promotion of wound healing', 'Synovial Fluid Lubrication']","['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cicatrizants', 'Compounds used in a research, industrial, or household setting', 'Dermatologicals', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Lubricants', 'Musculo-Skeletal System', 'Nasal Preparations', 'Ophthalmologicals', 'Polysaccharides', 'Preparations for Treatment of Wounds and Ulcers', 'Protective Agents', 'Sensory Organs', 'Surgical Aids', 'Viscoelastic Substances', 'Viscosupplements']"

The sensitivity of the uterus to the oxytocic effect is much greater toward the end of pregnancy. The oxytocic actions of ergonovine are greater than its vascular effects. Ergonovine, like other ergot alkaloids, produces arterial vasoconstriction by stimulation of alpha-adrenergic and serotonin receptors and inhibition of endothelial-derived relaxation factor release.

Pentoxyverine acts as an agonist at sigma receptors with the Ki of ± nM, as demonstrated in a competitive binding assay. The function of sigma receptors on cough suppressant activities is unclear, however these receptors are highly expressed in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) of the brainstem where the afferent fibres first synapse. NTS is located very close to the cough centre in the brainstem thus may function as a ‘gate' for the cough reflex and allow sigma- receptor agonists to modulate afferent activity prior to reaching the cough center. It is suggested that highly lipophilic sigma- agonists may penetrate the CNS following systemic administration.

Specifically, it results in the release of digestive enzymes and bile from the pancreas and gall bladder, respectively. It also acts as a hunger suppresant. Cholecystokinin is secreted by the duodenum when fat- or protein-rich chyme leaves the stomach and enters the duodenum.

In addition, there is a reduction in the risk for developing alpha-1 mediated ocular unwanted effects, such as conjunctival blanching, mydriasis, and eyelid retraction.11However, despite high alpha-2 receptor specificity, brimonidine may still produce alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated ocular effects, such as conjunctival vasoconstriction.6Brimonidine has a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post-dosing.LabelIn a randomized, double-blind clinical study, ocular administration of 0.2% brimonidine in healthy volunteers resulted in a 23% reduction of mean intraocular pressure from baseline at 3 hours following administration.3In comparative studies consisting of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, the ocular hypotensive effect of brimonidine was maintained during treatment periods of up to 1 year.1Brimonidine mediates vasoconstrictive effects and it was shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties inex vivohuman skin model andin vivoinflammation models.12In a clinial trials consisting of adults with moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea, brimonidine was shown to improve the extent of redness at 3 hours after application, compared to placebo.15It was shown to be a potent vasoconstrictor of human subcutaneous vessels with a diameter of less than 200 µm. Inin vivomouse inflammation models, brimonidine displayed anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting edema.8In a randomized, double-blind study, brimonidine reduced erythema for the 12 hours of the study in a dose-dependent manner.8When adminsitered systemically, brimonidine was shown to cause cardiovascular effects by decreasing blood pressure, decreasing heart and respiratory rate, and prolonging the PR interval in the electrocardiogram. This is due to the targeting of adrenoceptors by the drug.4,5Although the clinical significance has not been established, there is evidence that brimonidine exhibits neuroprotective activity in experimental models of cerebral ischemia and optic nerve injury.6In vitrostudies show that brimonidine mediated protective effects on neuronal cells from kainate acid insult and on cultured retinal ganglion cells from glutamate-induced cytotoxicity, which is a possible mediator of secondary neuronal degeneration in human glaucoma. Neuroprotective actions of brimonidine were also demonstrated in rat models of acute retinal ischemia and chronic IOP elevation. It has been proposed that brimonidine may exert neuroprotective effects on the retina and optic nerve by enhancing intrinsic retinal ganglion cell survival mechanisms and/or induction of neuronal survival factors, such as bFGF.3However, further investigations are needed to conclude on these possible therapeutic benefits of the drug.",BrC1=C(NC2=NCCN2)C=CC2=NC=CN=C12,"In the eye, alpha- adrenoceptors play a role in vasoconstriction, mydriasis, eyelid retraction, and elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) whereas alpha- adrenoceptors are responsible for IOP reduction via a complex Gi-coupled signaling cascade pathway. Activation of alpha- receptors leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and reduction of cyclic AMP levels. As a result, there is a decrease in norpinephrine (NE) release at the synaptic junction, NE-induced stimulation of beta- adrenoceptors, and production of aqueous humor by the ciliary epithelium.An elevated IOP is the most significant risk factor for developing glaucomatous optic neuropathy, which is associated with progressive visual field loss and functional disability if left untreated.Regardless of the etiology of the disease, the aim of current therapies for glaucoma is to reduce IOP, as reduction of IOP significantly reduces the risk of progression of vision loss even when IOP is already within the normal range.When administered ophthalmically, brimonidine is rapidly absorbed into the eye, acts as an agonist at ocular alpha- adrenoceptors and lowers IOP via a dual mechanism of action.It is proposed that initial dosing of the drug causes a reduction in aqueous humour production and chronic dosing leads to an increase in uveoscleral outflow.Brimonidine does not affect episcleral venous pressure.By reducing IOP, brimonidine aims to reduce the likelihood of glaucomatous visual field loss in ocular hypertension, and slow the progression of visual field defect in established open-angle glaucoma.When applied topically on skin, brimonidine reduces erythema through direct vasocontriction of small arteries and veins.As brimonidine mediates a potent peripheral vasoconstrictive activity by selectively working on the alpha- adrenoceptors, the use of brimonidine is thought to be efficacious for the treatment of facial erythema of rosacea, which is thought to arise from vasomotor instability and abnormal vasodilation of the superficial cutaneous vasculature of the face.TargetActionsOrganismAAlpha-A adrenergic receptoragonistHumansAAlpha-B adrenergic receptoragonistHumansAAlpha-C adrenergic receptoragonistHumans",[],"['Adrenergic Agents', 'Adrenergic Agonists', 'Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists', 'Adrenergic alpha-Agonists', 'Antiglaucoma Preparations and Miotics', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Decongestants and Antiallergics', 'Dermatologicals', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Hypotensive Agents', 'Misc.

It is taken up by norepinephrine transporters. It becomes concentrated in NE transmitter vesicles, replacing NE in these vesicles. This leads to a gradual depletion of NE stores in the nerve endings. Once inside the terminal it blocks the release of noradrenaline in response to arrival of an action potential. In contrast to ganglionic blocking agents, debrisoquin suppresses equally the responses mediated by alpha-and beta-adrenergic receptors but does not produce parasympathetic blockade. Since sympathetic blockade results in modest decreases in peripheral resistance and cardiac output, debrisoquin lowers blood pressure in the supine position.

The mechanism through which moexiprilat lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily inhibition of ACE activity. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor that also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex and provides negative feedback on renin secretion. ACE is identical to kininase II, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator. Moexiprilat is about  times as potent as moexipril in inhibiting ACE and kininase II. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased angiotensin II formation, leading to decreased vasoconstriction, increased plasma renin activity, and decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter results in diuresis and natriuresis and a small increase in serum potassium concentration (mean increases of about . mEq/L were seen when moexipril was used alone). Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of moexipril remains to be elucidated.

Alternative splicing allows the formation of channels composed of varying subunit isoforms expressed at different concentrations in different tissues.In pancreatic beta cells, ATP-sensitive potassium channels play a role as essential metabolic sensors and regulators that couple membrane excitability with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).When there is a decrease in the ATP:ADP ratio, the channels are activated and open, leading to K+ efflux from the cell, membrane hyperpolarization, and suppression of insulin secretion.In contrast, increased uptake of glucose into the cell leads to elevated intracellular ATP:ADP ratio, leading to the closure of channels and membrane depolarization. Depolarization leads to activation and opening of the voltage-dependent Ca+ channels and consequently an influx of calcium ions into the cell.Elevated intracellular calcium levels causes the contraction of the filaments of actomyosin responsible for the exocytosis of insulin granules stored in vesicles.Glimepiride blocks the ATP-sensitive potassium channel by binding non-specifically to the B sites of both sulfonylurea receptor- (SUR) and sulfonylurea receptor-A (SURA) subunits as well as the A site of SUR subunit of the channel to promote insulin secretion from the beta cell.TargetActionsOrganismAATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel inhibitorHumansAATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel inhibitorHumansAATP-binding cassette sub-family C member inducerHumans",[],"['Alimentary Tract and Metabolism', 'Amides', 'Blood Glucose Lowering Agents', 'BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs Used in Diabetes', 'Hypoglycemia-Associated Agents', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Insulin Secretagogues', 'Oral Hypoglycemics', 'Sulfones', 'Sulfonylureas', 'Sulfur Compounds']"

It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.4,5Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.4Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.8,9,10,11,12Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.4,5Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.15,14Skeletal Muscle EffectsPitavastatin may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal) and rhabdomyolysis (with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria). Rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statin use, including pitavastatin. Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (≥65 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. As dosages of pitavastatin greater than 4mg per day were associated with an increased risk of severe myopathy, the product monograph recommends a maximum daily dose of 4mg once daily.32The risk of myopathy during treatment with pitavstatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such asfenofibrate,niacin,gemfibrozil, andcyclosporine. Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered withcolchicine, and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.32Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.28Hepatic DysfunctionIncreases in serum transaminases have been reported with pitavastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and either resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including pitavastatin.32Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury.32Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose LevelsIncreases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including pitavastatin.

Miglustat is an inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, which is a glucosyl transferase enzyme responsible for catalyzing the formation of glucosylceramide (glucocerebroside). Glucosylceramide is a substrate for the endogenous glucocerebrosidase, an enzyme that is deficient in Gaucher's disease. The accumulation of glucosylceramide due to the absence of glucocerebrosidase results in the storage of this material in the lysosomes of tissue macrophages, leading to widespread pathology due to infiltration of lipid-engorged macrophages in the viscera, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. This results in secondary hematologic consequences including sever anemia and thrombocytopenia, in addition to the characteristic progressive hepatosplenomegaly, as well as skeletal complications including osteonecrosis and osteopenia with secondary pathological fractures.",CCCCN1C[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H]1CO,"Miglustat functions as a competitive and reversible inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, the initial enzyme in a series of reactions which results in the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids. The goal of treatment with miglustat is to reduce the rate of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis so that the amount of glycosphingolipid substrate is reduced to a level which allows the residual activity of the deficient glucocerebrosidase enzyme to be more effective (substrate reduction therapy), reducing the accumulation of glucocerebroside in macrophages. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that miglustat can reduce the synthesis of glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids. In clinical trials, miglustat improved liver and spleen volume, as well as hemoglobin concentration and platelet count. Inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis has also shown to reduce intracellular lipid storage, improve fluid-phase endosomal uptake and normalize lipid transport in peripheral blood B lymphocytes of NP-C patients, which results in a decrease in the potentially neurotoxic accumulation of gnagliosides GMand GM, lactosylceramide and glucosylceramide, possibly preventing further neuronal damage. Other studies have also suggested that miglustat may indirectly modulate intracellular calcium homeostasis through its effects on glucosylceramide levels, and evidence has shown that an initiating factor in the pathogenesis of NP-C may be impaired calcium homeostasis related to sphingosine storage. Therefore, the effect that miglustat exerts on intracellular calcium levels may influence an important underlying pathogenic mechanism of NP-C.TargetActionsOrganismACeramide glucosyltransferaseinhibitorHumans",[],"['Alimentary Tract and Metabolism', 'Alkaloids', 'Anti-HIV Agents', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Carbohydrates', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Gaucher Disease', 'Glucosylceramide Synthase Inhibitor', 'Glucosylceramide Synthase Inhibitors', 'Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors', 'Imines', 'Imino Pyranoses', 'Imino Sugars', 'Other Miscellaneous Therapeutic Agents', 'Piperidines', 'Various Alimentary Tract and Metabolism Products']"

Vestibular forms of vertigo are often accompanied by auditory dysfunctions such as hyperacusis, hearing loss, and tinnitus.In most cases, adaptive mechanisms of the CNS lead to functional recovery after episodes of vertigo, however, syndromes such as Ménière's disease tend to cause the recurrence of vertigo symptoms. This significantly impacts the quality of life and the ability to carry out daily activities.H-receptor activityThe mechanism of action of betahistine is multifactorial. Ménière's disease is thought to result from a disruption of endolymphatic fluid homeostasis in the ear.Betahistine mainly acts as a histamine H-receptor agonist. The stimulation of H-receptors in the inner ear causes a vasodilatory effect leading to increased permeability of blood vessels and a reduction in endolymphatic pressure; this action prevents the rupture of the labyrinth, which can contribute to the hearing loss associated with Ménière's disease. Betahistine is also purported to act by reducing the asymmetrical functioning of sensory vestibular organs and increasing vestibulocochlear blood flow, relieving symptoms of vertigo.H-receptor activityIn addition to the above mechanisms, betahistine also acts as a histamine H-receptor antagonist, increasing the turnover of histamine from postsynaptic histaminergic nerve receptors, subsequently leading to an increase in H-agonist activity. H-receptor antagonism elevates levels of neurotransmitters including serotonin in the brainstem, inhibiting the activity of vestibular nuclei, thus restoring proper balance and decreasing vertigo symptoms.TargetActionsOrganismAHistamine H receptoragonistHumansAHistamine H receptorantagonistHumans",[],"['Antivertigo Preparations', 'Histamine Agents', 'Histamine Agonists', 'Histamine Antagonists', 'Miscellaneous Central Nervous System Agents', 'Miscellaneous Therapeutic Agents', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'Pyridines', 'Vasodilating Agents']"

Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Opioids such as anileridine close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP and OP receptor agonist).

Trichloromethiazide has also been found useful in edema due to various forms of renal dysfunction such as nephrotic syndrome, acute glomer-ulonephritis, and chronic renal failure. Trichloromethiazide is also indicated in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effectiveness of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension. Like other thiazides, Trichloromethiazide promotes water loss from the body (diuretics). They inhibit Na+/Cl-reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood.

As a diuretic, Trichloromethiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like Trichloromethiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of Trichloromethiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle.TargetActionsOrganismASolute carrier family  member inhibitorHumansASodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit alpha-inhibitorHumansUCarbonic anhydrase inhibitorHumansUCarbonic anhydrase inhibitorHumansUCarbonic anhydrase inhibitorHumans",[],"['Antihypertensive Agents', 'Benzothiadiazines', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Diuretics', 'Genito Urinary System and Sex Hormones', 'Gynecological Antiinfectives and Antiseptics', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Fused-Ring', 'Hyperglycemia-Associated Agents', 'Low-Ceiling Diuretics and Potassium-Sparing Agents', 'Membrane Transport Modulators', 'Natriuretic Agents', 'Sodium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors', 'Sulfonamides', 'Sulfones', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'Thiazides']"

It also promotes the breakdown of lipids (lipolysis), and proteins, leading to the mobilization of extrahepatic amino acids and ketone bodies. This leads to increased circulating glucose concentrations (in the blood). There is also decreased glycogen formation in the liver.TargetActionsOrganismAGlucocorticoid receptoragonistHumansUSmoothened homologagonistHumans",[],"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Anti-Allergic Agents', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Corticosteroid Hormone Receptor Agonists', 'Corticosteroids', 'Corticosteroids, Dermatological Preparations', 'Corticosteroids, Potent (Group III)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inducers (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Dermatologicals', 'Fused-Ring Compounds', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Hormones', 'Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone Antagonists', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Pregnadienes', 'Pregnanes', 'Steroids', 'Steroids, Fluorinated', 'Thyroxine-binding globulin inhibitors']"

Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue. Chlorothiazide affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. At maximal therapeutic dosages, all thiazides are approximately equal in their diuretic efficacy. Chlorothiazide increases excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate.

The initial onset of blood glucose-lowering effect occurs around 30 minutes post-administration with the duration of action lasting for about 12 to 24 hours.8While the chronic use of glipizide does not result in elevations in the fasting insulin levels over time, the postprandial insulin response, or insulin response to a meal, is observed to be enhanced, even after 6 months of treatment.LabelThe main therapeutic actions of glipizide primarily occur at the pancreas where the insulin release is stimulated, but glipizide also mediates some extrapancreatic effects, such as the promotion of insulin signaling effects on the muscles, fat, or liver cells.9Due to its action on the endogenous cells, sulfonylureas including glipizide is associated with a risk for developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in patients receiving the drug.5,6Chronic administration of glipizide may result in down-regulation of the sulfonylurea receptors on pancreatic beta cells, which are molecular targets of the drug, leading to a reduced effect on insulin secretion.4Like other sulfonylureas, glipizide may work on pancreatic delta (δ) cells and alpha (α) cells to stimulate the secretion of somatostatin and suppress the secretion of glucagon, which are peptide hormones that regulate neuroendocrine and metabolic pathways. Other than its primary action on the pancreas, glipizide also exerts other biological actions outside of the pancreas, or ""extrapancreatic effects"", which is similar to other members of the sulfonylurea drug class. Glipizide may enhance the glucose uptake into the skeletal muscles and potentiate the action of insulin in the liver. Other effects include inhibited lipolysis in the liver and adipose tissue, inhibited hepatic glucose output, and increased uptake and oxidation of glucose. It has also been demonstrated by several studies that the chronic therapeutic use of sulfonylureas may result in an increase in insulin receptors expressed on monocytes, adipocytes, and erythrocytes.4",CC1=NC=C(N=C1)C(=O)NCCC1=CC=C(C=C1)S(=O)(=O)NC(=O)NC1CCCCC1,"Type  diabetes mellitus (TDM) is a chronic metabolic disorder with increasing prevalence worldwide. Characterized by higher-than-normal levels of blood glucose, TDM is a complex disorder that arises from the interaction between genetic, environmental and behavioral risk factors. Insulin is a peptide hormone that plays a critical role in regulating blood glucose levels. In response to high blood glucose levels, insulin promotes the uptake of glucose into the liver, muscle cells, and fat cells for storage. Although there are multiple events occurring that lead to the pathophysiology of TDM, the disorder mainly involves insulin insensitivity as a result of insulin resistance, declining insulin production, and eventual failure of beta cells of pancreatic islets that normally produce insulin.Early management with lifestyle intervention, such as controlled diet and exercise, is critical in reducing the risk of long-term secondary complications, such as cardiovascular mortality.Glipizide, like other sulfonylurea drugs, is an insulin secretagogue, which works by stimulating the insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells thereby increasing the plasma concentrations of insulin.Thus, the main therapeutic action of the drug depends on the functional beta cells in the pancreatic islets.Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor expressed on the pancreatic beta-cell plasma membrane, leading to the closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel and reduced potassium conductance. This results in depolarization of the pancreatic beta cell and opening of the voltage-sensitive calcium channels, promoting calcium ion influx. Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium ions in beta cells stimulates the secretion, or exocytosis, of insulin granules from the cells.Label,Apart from this main mechanism of action, the blood-glucose-lowering effect of glipizide involves increased peripheral glucose utilization via stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and by increasing the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors.TargetActionsOrganismAATP-binding cassette sub-family C member inhibitorHumansUPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gammaagonistHumans",[],"['Alimentary Tract and Metabolism', 'Blood Glucose Lowering Agents', 'BSEP/ABCB11 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Drugs Used in Diabetes', 'Hypoglycemia-Associated Agents', 'Insulin Secretagogues', 'Oral Hypoglycemics', 'Sulfones', 'Sulfonylureas', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'UGT1A1 Substrates']"

Additionally, angiotensin II acts on the adrenal cortex where it stimulates aldosterone release. Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the nephron.Aliskiren prevents the above process via binding to renin at its active site, stopping the cleavage of angiotensin, in turn inhibiting the formation of angiotensin I.

In a study of healthy volunteers, Tianeptine-treated subjects were less accurate at identifying facial expressions, suggesting a lack of improvement in the psychomotor symptoms of depression. The tianeptine group also showed reduced memory and reduced attentional vigilance to various stimuli6.",CN1C2=CC=CC=C2C(NCCCCCCC(O)=O)C2=C(C=C(Cl)C=C2)S1(=O)=O,"Recent studies suggest that tianeptine acts as a full agonist at the mu-type opioid receptor (MOR),. The mu opioid receptors are currently being studied as effective targets for antidepressant therapies. It is believed that the clinical effects of tianeptine are owed to its modulation of these receptors. In addition to its actions on the opioid receptor, previous studies have owed its action to its effect on the serotonin receptor,, dopamine (D/) receptors, and glutamate receptors,, as discussed below:Tianeptine has challenged the monoaminergic hypothesis of depression, as well as the widely supported monoaminergic mechanisms whereby the action of most known antidepressants have been explained. Specifically, this drug is thought to persistently alter glutamate receptor bursting of the hippocampal CA commissural associational synapse. Current research suggests that tianeptine produces its antidepressant effects through the modulation of glutamate receptor activity (for example, AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors) and affect the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which impacts neural plasticity. More recent studies by support the role of tianeptine in the modulation of glutaminergic activity in the amygdala, the emotional region of the brain associated with memories.Tianeptine reduces the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response to stress, and thus prevents stress-related behavioral issues,. In rodents, the stress of acute restraint increases extracellular levels of glutamate in the basolateral amygdala an effect that was inhibited by tianeptine. Interestingly, the SSRI fluoxetine increased extracellular glutamate levels in the basolateral amygdala regardless of stress conditions. These data demonstrate that the mechanism of action of tianeptine is distinct from SSRIs and support the hypothesis that the mechanism of action of tianeptine relates to alteration of glutaminergic activity in the amygdala and the hippocampus,,.In addition to the above mechanisms, tianeptine is a unique antidepressant and anxiolytic medication that stimulates the uptake of serotonin (-hydroxytryptamine; -HT), and -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (-HIAA) in brain tissue.Although the monoaminergic neurotransmitters serotonin (-HT), noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) are proven to be related to the occurrence of depressive disorders, it is now recognized that monoamine deficits are not sufficient to explain the mechanism of action of antidepressant medications.TargetActionsOrganismAMu-type opioid receptoragonistHumansUGlutamate receptor modulatorHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor AinhibitorHumansUDopamine D receptoragonistHumans",[],"['Agents Causing Muscle Toxicity', 'Agents that produce hypertension', 'Agents that reduce seizure threshold', 'Analgesics', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic', 'Azepines', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates with a Narrow Therapeutic Index', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs', 'Nervous System', 'Neurotoxic agents', 'Psychoanaleptics', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Serotonergic Drugs Shown to Increase Risk of Serotonin Syndrome', 'Serotonin Agents', 'Serotonin Modulators', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'Thiepins']"

The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH)2 D3], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis.1 Decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2 D3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2 D3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy.

It is now known that the thyroid gland secretes approximately ten times more T4 than T3 and that 80% of serum T3 is derived from deiodination of T4 in peripheral tissues. Administration of levothyroxine alone is sufficient for maintaining serum T4 and T3 levels in most patients and combination hormone replacement therapy generally offers no therapeutic advantage.

Patients receiving anthracycline-derivative antineoplastic agents may experience three types of cardiotoxicity: acute transient type; chronic, subacute type (related to cumulative dose and has a more indolent onset later on); and a late-onset type that manifests years after therapy, mainly in patients that have been exposed to the drug as a child. Although the exact mechanism of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is not known, it has shown to exert a variety of actions that may result in the development of cardiotoxicity. In animals, anthracyclines cause a selective inhibition of cardiac muscle gene expression for α-actin, troponin, myosin light-chain 2, and the M isoform of creatine kinase. This may lead to myofibrillar loss associated with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Anthracyclines may also cause myocyte damage via calcium overload, altered myocardial adrenergic function, release of vasoactive amines, and proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the main cause of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is associated with free-radical damage to DNA. The drugs intercalate DNA, chelate metal ions to produce drug-metal complexes, and generate superoxide radicals via oxidation-reduction reactions. Anthracyclines also contain a quinone structure that can undergo reduction via NADPH-dependent reactions to produce a semiquinone free radical that initiates a cascade of superoxide and hydroxide radical generation. Chelation of metal ions, particularly iron, by anthracyclines results in an anthracycline-metal complex that catalyzes the generation of reactive oxygen free radicals. This complex is a powerful oxidant that can initiate lipid peroxidation in the absence of oxygen free radicals. The toxicity induced by antrhacyclines may be exacerbated in cardiac cells, as these cells do not possess sufficient amounts of certain enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) involved in detoxifying free radicals and protecting the cells from subsequent damage.",C[C@@H](CN1CC(=O)NC(=O)C1)N1CC(=O)NC(=O)C1,"The mechanism by which dexrazoxane exerts its cardioprotective activity is not fully understood.

These correspond to cholesterol efflux trasporters and likely explain the reductiion in HDL and LDL seen with rhein. The inhibition of LXR by rhien relieves the inhibition on uncoupling protein  expression in brown adipose tissue. The result of this is increased thermogenesis which likely plays a role in the reduction of body weight produced by rhien. Additionally, rhein may downregulate peroxisome proliferator-receptor gamma and its downstream genes to inhibit adipocyte differentiation.Anti-oxidant/Pro-oxidant:The antoxidant mechanism is unknown. The pro-oxidant action of rhien may involve the inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complex  and subsequent facilitation of NADH and NADPH dependent lipid peroxidation.Anti-cancer:The exact mechanism of rhein's ability to damage DNA and supress the expression of DNA repair enzymes ADR and MGMT is unknown. The mechanism through which rhien induces ER stress is unknown but likely involves its pro-oxidant properties. Rhein has been observed to produce increases in cytosolic calcium, reductions in mitochondrial membrane potential, and upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins as well as leakage of cytochrome C which would induce apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway. The reduction of matrix metalloproteinase- serves to prevent extra cellular matrix breakdown by cancer cells and hinders their invasion into surrounding tissue. Rhein also decreases vascular endothelial growth factor expression through an unknown mechanism to prevent cancer cells from stimulating agiogenesis. Rhein reduces the activity of the nuclear factor kappa (NFkappaB) pathway by preventing the destruction of IKBalpha. The activity of the phosphoinositol -kinase/Akt pathway is also reduced by rhien. Rhein's inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (particularly those involving extracellular signal regulated kinase) appears to follow a U-shaped dose response curve.

DB01072,Atazanavir,Atazanaviris an antiviral protease inhibitor used in combination with other antiretrovirals for the treatment of HIV.,['Q72874'],"Atazanavir (ATV) is an azapeptide HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Atazanavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs. Atazanivir is pharmacologically related but structurally different from other protease inhibitors and other currently available antiretrovirals.6Atazanavir exhibits anti-HIV-1 activity with a mean 50% effective concentration (EC50) in the absence of human serum of 2 to 5 nM against a variety of laboratory and clinical HIV-1 isolates grown in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages, CEM-SS cells, and MT-2 cells.10Atazanavir has activity against HIV-1 Group M subtype viruses A, B, C, D, AE, AG, F, G, and J isolates in cell culture. Atazanavir has variable activity against HIV-2 isolates (1.9-32 nM), with EC50values above the EC50values of failure isolates. Two-drug combination antiviral activity studies with atazanavir showed no antagonism in cell culture with PIs (amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir), NNRTIs (delavirdine, efavirenz, and nevirapine), NRTIs (abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir DF, and zidovudine), the HIV-1 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide, and two compounds used in the treatment of viral hepatitis, adefovir and ribavirin, without enhanced cytotoxicity.10HIV-1 isolates with a decreased susceptibility to atazanavir have been selected in cell culture and obtained from patients treated with atazanavir or atazanavir with ritonavir. HIV-1 isolates with 93- to 183-fold reduced susceptibility to atazanavir from three different viral strains were selected in cell culture for 5 months. The substitutions in these HIV-1 viruses that contributed to atazanavir resistance include I50L, N88S, I84V, A71V, and M46I. Changes were also observed at the protease cleavage sites following drug selection. Recombinant viruses containing the I50L substitution without other major PI substitutions were growth impaired and displayed increased susceptibility in cell culture to other PIs (amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir). The I50L and I50V substitutions yielded selective resistance to atazanavir and amprenavir, respectively, and did not appear to be cross-resistant.10Concentration- and dose-dependent prolongation of the PR interval in the electrocardiogram has been observed in healthy subjects receiving atazanavir. In placebo-controlled Study AI424-076, the mean (±SD) maximum change in PR interval from the predose value was 24 (±15) msec following oral dosing with 400 mg of atazanavir (n=65) compared to 13 (±11) msec following dosing with placebo (n=67). The PR interval prolongations in this study were asymptomatic. There is limited information on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction in humans between atazanavir and other drugs that prolong the PR interval of the electrocardiogram.Electrocardiographic effects of atazanavir were determined in a clinical pharmacology study of 72 healthy subjects. Oral doses of 400 mg (maximum recommended dosage) and 800 mg (twice the maximum recommended dosage) were compared with placebo; there was no concentration-dependent effect of atazanavir on the QTc interval (using Fridericia’s correction).

The reduction in calcium flux increases the amount of calcium deposited in bone resulting in an increase in bone mineral density. The reduction in PTH secretion also reduces the amount of vitamin D metabolized to its active form, calcidiol. Since calcidiol increases the expression of calcium dependent ATPases and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member  (TRPV) both of which are involved in calcium uptake from the gut, a reduction in calcidiol results in less calcium absorption.

The inotropic effect of pyruvate requires intracoronary infusion. Among possible mechanisms for this effect are increased generation of ATP and an increase in ATP phosphorylation potential. Another is activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, promoting its own oxidation by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is inactivated in ischemia myocardium. Yet another is reduction of cytosolic inorganic phosphate concentration. Pyruvate, as an antioxidant, is known to scavenge such reactive oxygen species as hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides.

Tipravanir may bind to the active site of the protease enzyme with fewer hydrogen bonds than peptidic protease inhibitors, which results in increased flexibility, allowing it to fit into the active site of the enzyme in viruses that have become resistance to other protease inhibitors.

While the exact mechanism of action is not certain, theories exist as to how artemisinins produce their antimalarial effect.Artemisinins are believed to bind to haem within theP. falciparumparasite,. The source of this haem varies with the life stage of the parasite. When the parasite is in the early ring stage artemisinins are believed to bind haem produced by the parasite's haem biosynthesis pathway. In later stages artemisinins likely bind to haem released by haemoglobin digestion. Once bound to haem, artemisinins are thought to undergo activation involving ferrous iron via reductive scission which splits the endoperoxide bridge to produce a reactive oxygen,. This reactive oxygen is thought to undergo a subsequent intramolecular hydrogen abstraction to produce a reactive carbon radical. The carbon radical is believed to be the source of the drugs potent activity againstP. falciparumby alkylating a wide array of protein targets,,. The nature and magnitude of the effect on specific protein function as a result of this alkylation is unknown.One target which has been the focus of research is the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca+ ATPase pump ofP. falciparum. Artemisinins have been found to irreversably bind to and inhibit this protein at a binding site similar to that of Thapsigargin. The mechanism is likely the same as for other proteins, namely alkylation via the carbon radical intermediate.Artemisinins appear to preferentially collect in infected erythrocytes, concentrating the drug by several hundred-fold compared to uninfected cells. This may play a role in why little alkylation is seen in uninfected erythrocytes.TargetActionsOrganismUActin, cytoplasmic ligandHumansUAlpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenaseligandHumansUAnnexin

With chronic administration in Type II diabetic patients, the blood glucose lowering effect persists despite a gradual decline in the insulin secretory response to the drug.

The negative allosteric modulatory effects of CBD are therapeutically important as direct agonists are limited by their psychomimetic effects while direct antagonists are limited by their depressant effects.There is further evidence that CBD also activates -HTA serotonergic and TRPV– vanilloid receptors, antagonizes alpha- adrenergic and µ-opioid receptors, inhibits synaptosomal uptake of noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and gaminobutyric acid and cellular uptake of anandamide, acts on mitochondria Ca stores, blocks low-voltage-activated (T-type) Ca channels, stimulates activity of the inhibitory glycine-receptor, and inhibits activity of fatty amide hydrolase (FAAH),.TargetActionsOrganismACannabinoid receptor Not AvailableHumansACannabinoid receptor Not AvailableHumansUG-protein coupled receptor inverse agonistHumansUGlycine receptor subunit alpha-Not AvailableHumansUGlycine receptor (alpha-/beta)Not AvailableHumansUGlycine receptor subunit alpha-Not AvailableHumansUN-arachidonyl glycine receptorNot AvailableHumansUG-protein coupled receptor Not AvailableHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor ANot AvailableHumansU-hydroxytryptamine receptor ANot AvailableHumansUNeuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-Not AvailableHumansUDelta-type opioid receptorNot AvailableHumansUMu-type opioid receptorNot AvailableHumansUPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gammaNot AvailableHumansUTransient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member Not AvailableHumansUVoltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-GNot AvailableHumansUVoltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-HNot AvailableHumansUVoltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-INot AvailableHumansUTransient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member Not AvailableHumansUTransient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member Not AvailableHumansUTransient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member Not AvailableHumansUTransient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member Not AvailableHumansUTransient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member Not AvailableHumansUVoltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein Not AvailableHumansUProstaglandin G/H synthase inhibitorHumansUProstaglandin G/H synthase inhibitorHumansUAcetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, mitochondrialinhibitorHumansUSteroid -alpha-hydroxylase/, lyaseinhibitorHumansU-hydroxy--methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductasestimulatorHumansUGlutathione reductase, mitochondrialstimulatorHumansUGlutathione peroxidase stimulatorHumansUIndoleamine ,-dioxygenase inhibitorHumansUArylalkylamine N-acetyltransferaseinhibitorHumansUCytochrome P BinhibitorHumansUCytochrome P AinhibitorHumansUCytochrome P DsubstrateinhibitorHumansUCytochrome P AinhibitorHumansUCytochrome P AinhibitorHumansUCytochrome P AinhibitorHumansUQuinone oxidoreductaseinhibitorHumansUCatalaseinhibitorHumansUFatty-acid amide hydrolase inhibitorinducerHumansUSuperoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn]inhibitorHumansUN-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidaseinhibitorHumans",[],"['Agents producing tachycardia', 'Analgesics', 'BCRP/ABCG2 Inhibitors', 'Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists', 'Cannabinoids and similars', 'Central Nervous System Agents', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A5 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A7 Inhibitors (strength unknown)', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Peripheral Nervous System Agents', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Sensory System Agents', 'Terpenes']"

It exhibits several biological roles but predominantly exerts an inhibitory effect on secretion of other hormones and transmitters1. While distribution of two active isoforms of somatostatin is similar, SST-14 is more predominant in the enteric neurons and peripheral nerves whereas SST-28 is more prominent in the retina and intestinal mucosal cells1.Anterior pituitary gland and brain:It inhibits the release of growth hormones and thyroid-stimulating hormones, such as thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyrotrophin, from the anterior pituitary while inhibiting the release of dopamine from the midbrain, norepinephrine, TRH and corticotrophin-releasing hormone in the brain1.Pancreas:In the pancreas, somatostatin reduces the secretion of glucagon and insulin as well as bicarbonate ions and other enzymes1,9.Thyroid gland:Somatosatin reduces secretion of T3, T4, and calcitonin1. Somatostatin regulates the thyroid function by reducing basal TSH release9.Gastrointestinal tract:It attenuates the release of most gastrointestinal hormones such as gastrin, secretin, motilin, gastric acid, enteroglucagon, cholecystokinin (CCK), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), intrinsic factor, pepsin, neurotensin, as well as bile secretion and colonic fluid secretion1.Adrenal gland:It inhibits angiotensin II-stimulated aldosterone secretion and acetylcholine-induced medullary catecholamine secretion1.Eye/retina:Somatostatin inhibits the production of vascular endothelial growth factor1.Inflammatory cells and sensory nerves:The expression of somatostatin has been found in inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells to act as an autocrine or paracrine regulator in local immune responses. Findings suggest that somatostatin may play a role in exerting local and systemic anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects1. On primary afferent neurons, somatostatin reduces the responses to thermal stimulation in C-mechanoheat sensitive fibers in a dose-dependent fashion and reduces the responses of C-mechanoheat fibers to bradykinin-induced excitation and sensitization to heat6. Somatostatin is reported to elicit an analgesic effect when applied intrathecally; there is evidence supporting that similar effects may occur when systemically used to treat endocrine disorders9.Somatostatin is thought to reduce bleeding from esophageal varices by causing splanchnic vasoconstriction2.

By inhibiting intracellular cyclic AMP and Ca+ and by a receptor-linked distal effect on exocytosis, SSTRs block cell secretion. The common pathway shared by the receptors involve the activation of phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP), and modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). With the exception of SSTR, activation of SSTRs lead to activation of voltage-gated potassium channels accompanied by increased K+ currents. This result in membrane hyperpolarization and inhibits depolarization-induced Ca+ influx through voltage-sensitive Ca+ channels. Depending on the receptor subtype, signalling cascades involve activation of other downstream targets such as Na+/H+ exchanger, Rho GTPase, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). SSTRs  to  bind both somatostatin isoforms with equal nanomolar binding affinity whereas SSTR exhibits a - to -fold higher binding affinity for SST-.Effects of SSTR:Upon biding of somatostatin and activation, SSTR mediates an antisecretory effect on growth hormone, prolactin and calcitonin.Effects of SSTR:SSTR subtype dominates in endocrine tissues. By binding to SST receptors, somatostatin exerts paracrine inhibitory actions on gastrin release from G cells, histamine release from ECL cells, and directly on parietal cell acid output. SSTR receptor signalling cascades also inhibit the secretion of growth hormone and that of adrenocorticotropin, glucagon, insulin, and interferon-γ.Effects of SSTR:Activation of these receptors lead to reduction in cell proliferation. SSTR triggers PTP-dependent cell apoptosis accompanied by activation of p and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. A study of the matrigel sponge assay suggests that through SSTR-mediated inhibition of both NOS and MAPK activities may lead to the antitumor effects of somatostatin in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis.Effects of SSTR:The functions of SSTR remain largely unknown.Effects of SSTR:Like SSTR, SSTR subtype also predominates in endocrine tissues. Upon activation, SSTR signalling cascades exert an inhibitory action on growth hormone, adrenocorticotropin, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide- as well as the secretion of amylase.The presence of somatostatin receptors has been identified in most neuroendocrine tumours, endocrine gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) tumors, paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas, medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC) and small cell lung carcinomas. The antitumor effects of somatostatin were also effective in various malignant lymphomas and breast tumours. Gastrointestinal hormones, such as gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin (CCK), as well as growth hormones and growth factors are thought to be elevated in gastrointestinal tract and neuroendocrine tumours and are inhibited by somatostatin.In vitro, somatostatin inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced DNA synthesis and replication following which suggest that somatostatin may have direct anti-proliferative effects via SSTR signalling. Acromegaly is characterized as the endocrine disorder caused by a functioning tumour of cells that secrete growth hormone from the anterior pituitary. Somatostatin analogue therapies serve to normalize the elevated levels of GH and insulin-like growth factor  (IGF-) and attenuate tumour growth.In the vascular system this likely produces vasoconstriction by inhibiting adenylate cyclase leading to a lowering the concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the endothelial cells which ultimately blocks vasodilation through this pathway. This vasoconstriction is though the be responsible for reducing blood flow to the esophageal tissues and so reduces bleeding from esophageal varices.Somatostatin mediates an analgesic activity by reducing vascular and nociceptive components of inflammation. Studies indicate that somatostatin may be present in nociceptive DRG neurons with C-fibers and primary afferent neurons to inhibit the release of transmitters at the presynaptic junctions of the sensory-efferent nerve terminals.

In addition, the production of free radicals may contribute to its anti-psoriatic effect. In vitro studies demonstrate that anthralin prolongs the prophase component of mitosis for keratinocytes and leukocytes. Prophase is the first step of mitosis, the process separating the duplicated genetic material carried in the nucleus of a parent cell into two identical daughter cells. In vivo studies demonstrate that anthralin blocks DNA synthesis and can increase the release of reactive oxygen species.Anthralin is believed to normalize the rate of epidermal cell proliferation and keratinization by reducing the mitotic activity of the epidermal hyperplasia in psoriasis.Anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects of anthralin have been demonstrated on both psoriatic and healthy skin. The anti-proliferative effects of anthralin are thought to be due to a combination of inhibition of DNA synthesis and its strong reducing properties. The effectiveness of anthralin as an anti-psoriatic agent is partly owed to its ability to promote lipid peroxidation and reduce the concentration of endothelial adhesion molecules, which are found to be elevated in psoriatic patients,.Recent studies suggest that its ability to prevent T-lymphocyte activation and normalize keratinocyte differentiation may occur by a direct effect on mitochondria.TargetActionsOrganismAKeratin, type II cytoskeletal  epidermalantagonistHumansAKeratin, type I cytoskeletal antagonistHumansUC-Jun-amino-terminal kinase-interacting protein agonistHumans",[],"['Anthracenes', 'Antipsoriatics', 'Antipsoriatics for Topical Use', 'Antracen Derivatives', 'Dermatologicals']"

Upon binding of cytokines and growth factors, JAKs are activated, undergoing cross-phosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation. This process also reveals selective binding sites for STATs, which are DNA-binding proteins that also bind to the cytoplasmic region of cytokine or growth factor receptors. Activated JAKs and STATs translocate to the nucleus as transcription factors to regulate gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-, IL-, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB).They also activate downstream pathways that promote erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic development.The molecular pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms is not fully understood; however, JAK is constitutively activated and the JAK-STAT signalling pathway becomes deregulated and aberrant.,Ruxolitinib is a selective and potent inhibitor of JAK and JAK, with some affinity against JAK and TYK. Anticancer effects of ruxolitinib are attributed to its inhibition of JAKs and JAK-mediated phosphorylation of STAT.By downregulating the JAK-STAT pathway, ruxolitinib inhibits myeloproliferation and suppresses the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL- and TNF-α.Activated JAKs are also implicated in graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), which is a severe immune complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation GVHD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially for patients who do not respond well to corticosteroid therapy.

It is normally applied to a plastic tape called Cordran. Cordran is primarily effective because of its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions. Flurandrenolide, which is slowly released from the Cordran tape, binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin- (annexin-) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. Cyclooxygenase (both COX- and COX-) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In another words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin- escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding. Like other glucocorticoid agents Fluocinolone acetonide acts as a physiological antagonist to insulin by decreasing glycogenesis (formation of glycogen). It also promotes the breakdown of lipids (lipolysis), and proteins, leading to the mobilization of extrahepatic amino acids and ketone bodies. This leads to increased circulating glucose concentrations (in the blood).

Resorcinol interferes with the iodination of tyrosine and the oxidation of iodide6,4. In an in vitro study involving lactoperoxidase (LPO) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO), it was shown that the mechanism of these two enzymes can become irreversibly inhibited by way of a suicide inactivation by resorcinol6,4.It is believed that the Fe3+ of the porphyrin residue of the peroxidase to is oxidised to Fe4+ by hydrogen peroxide with the transfer of an oxygen radical6,4. In LPO and TPO, the resulting π-cation radical of the porphyrin can isomerize to a radical cation with the radical in an aromatic side chain of the enzyme6,4. The latter radical can bind, in a pH-dependent reaction, covalently and irreversibly to the resorcinol radical formed during regular oxidation of resorcinol and this reduces the activity of the enzyme greatly6,4. While the inactivation of the enzyme and the binding of resorcinol to the enzyme may be largely increased by the presence of 0.1 nM iodide, increasing the iodide concentration to 5 mM reduced the resorcinol binding to the enzyme by one quarter but increased the enzyme activity, determined as the rate of iodination of tyrosine, more than proportionally from 6.2% to 44.7%6,4. Nevertheless, the role played by iodide ions in the irreversible inactivation of the enzymes is not yet fully elucidated6,4.Ultimately, such in vitro and in vivo data propose that the anti-thyroidal activity of resorcinol is caused by inhibition of thyroid peroxidase enzymes, resulting in decreased thyroid hormone production and increased proliferation due to an increase in the secretion of TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone)6,4. The iodination process is catalyzed by a haem-containing enzyme, and resorcinol is known to form covalent bonds with haem6,4.Despite the legitimacy of this pharmacodynamic profile in resorcinol, the therapeutic uses for which it may be formally indicated for at this time do not actually rely upon any of these mechanisms or dynamics, which are primarily elicited only upon systemic exposure to resorcinol or particularly high overdosage of the agent. This is especially true, considering resorcinol is most commonly available as topical applications to the public.",OC1=CC(O)=CC=C1,"Data regarding the specific mechanisms of action of resorcinol does not appear to be readily accessible in the literature.

By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation. Activation of ClC- chloride channels may also stimulate the recovery of muscosal barrier function by restoring tight junction protein complexes in the intestine.

Upon binding, apalutamide disrupts AR signalling, inhibits DNA binding, and impedes AR-mediated gene transcription.Apalutamide impairs the translocation of AR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus thus reducing the concentrations of AR available to interact with the androgen response elements (AREs).Upon treatment with apalutamide, AR was not recruited to the DNA promoter regions.Its main metabolite, N-desmethyl apalutamide, is a less potent inhibitor of AR, and exhibited one-third of the activity of apalutamide in an in vitro transcriptional reporter assay.TargetActionsOrganismAAndrogen receptorantagonistHumansNGABA(A) ReceptorantagonistHumans",['Androgen Deprivation Therapy'],"['Androgen Receptor Inhibitors', 'Antiandrogens', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents', 'BCRP/ABCG2 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 Inducers (strong)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9 Inducers (weak)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers (strong)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Inducers (strong)', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 Substrates', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers', 'Cytochrome P-450 Substrates', 'Drugs that are Mainly Renally Excreted', 'Endocrine Therapy', 'Hormone Antagonists and Related Agents', 'Imidazoles', 'Imidazolidines', 'MATE 1 Inhibitors', 'MATE 2 Inhibitors', 'MATE inhibitors', 'OAT3/SLC22A8 Inhibitors', 'OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 Inducers', 'OCT2 Inhibitors', 'P-glycoprotein inducers', 'Prostatic Neoplasms, drug therapy']"
